THERE was a rustic of sorts<br>
Who purchased a pair of blackbirds:<br>
One to kill the other.<br>
One blackbird was killed,<br>
And he bought another and it was killed.<br>
He then bought two more:<br>
And then two more,<br>
And then another and another.<br>
He kept it up till seven<br>
Were killed by the one remaining.<br>
He went to the druggist<br>
And was drug to the door,<br>
And as he was carried home<br>
He murmured, before he could speak plain,<br>
"Give me some more birds."<br>

ONE BY ONE they are taking away the birds, and I know every one, and I know myself.<br>
I have lost them all and yet I call every one by name.<br>
Habit is a great deadener of pain; and I have lost them all.<br>
It comes over me that I have only to make a small effort, open the window, and there will be all my birds at the sill.<br>
I shall just say out loud,<br>
"Come"--<br>
And they will come.<br>
And they will all be back in place all at once, as if they had never been away.<br>
And I will say to them, "How well you sing."<br>
And they will sing.<br>

There were thirty-six blackbirds who were shot dead in Cambridge, Massachusetts,<br>
On March sixth thirty-one years ago.<br>
Some say they died of fright<br>
From the satanic thunder<br>
Of Marine Corps bombers.<br>
At midnight of that day<br>
They came from their roosts in the trees<br>
To meet their enemy, the frightful blast<br>
There was a difference in their demeanour from other blackbirds<br>
<br>
Thirty-six blackbirds were shot dead in Cambridge, Massachusetts,<br>
Only two came from other states,<br>
Some flew east, some flew west, some flew across the sea,<br>
Most just simply flew apart.<br>
The three I knew best were from areas of Guatemala<br>
Who were surviving members of what was once a great family.<br>
There are new families now<br>
Newborn blackbirds of all different sizes,<br>
And tomorrow another blackbird dies.<br>
Of all the death in all the wars<br>
That have taken place from time to time<br>
Only the deaths of these thirty-six blackbirds<br>
Could not be justified.<br>
<br>
There were thirty-six blackbirds<br>
And we killed them<br>
We, their cousins<br>
We've killed the hawk and the crow, too,<br>
A squaw and a crow and a red-tailed hawk.<br>

The days dwindle down to a precious few.<br>
The sun burns the shoreline as the masts burn sixty feet high.<br>
On the waterfront they are unloading the poor sardines.<br>
As the twilight draws on, the children hurry home from school.<br>
Pale firelight on a girl’s face at her window, her hands busy with her hair;<br>
Languidly lean and languid pale, to the indolent tapping of her foot.<br>
The streets grow dark.<br>
<br>
The night-watch goes his rounds.<br>
The fire-light on her face grows stronger, and dies down again.<br>
Weak firelight on her face by the window, with the tapping of her foot.<br>
She is finished now, and the mirror is responding<br>
To the firelight on her face by the window, with the water running cold.<br>

The only singer in the woods,<br>
Poor wanderer! I have heard<br>
At times a strain like this,<br>
Some woods at eventide,<br>
When summer sun and summer shade,<br>
Were mingled, seem to sanction heaves<br>
Profuse, opulent, of joy and woe,<br>
An heaven in this poor earth re-created.<br>
<br>
He sings above the woods, and through the glade;<br>
He is the lord of this still haunt;<br>
As he is singing now,<br>
When the golden light grows dim.<br>
He is singing to himself<br>
How he listens at his song!<br>
Thinking how that this might be indeed Cheerful,<br>
as are the strains he flings,<br>
Perchance, a long time to this day<br>
He will watch from his lofty perch,<br>
When twilight leaves the sky.<br>
He can know no meaner bliss<br>
Than singing at the east;<br>
And not a fragment of it his,<br>
But what comes from the heart.<br>

Last night I dreamed the moon was so close I could almost touch it,<br>
but it was not gently floating as in previous dreams but was red,<br>
smoldering like a piece of fire.<br>
<br>
I stood in a field that had turned to glass.<br>
Even my shadow on the ground was hard,<br>
divided into tiny prisms that scattered the light like dust.<br>
<br>
I wanted to tear my shadow loose and grow tall like a tree,<br>
broad branches spreading as I sank deep my roots into the ground.<br>
But it was not safe to sleep, so I walked in the cold light of the moon.<br>
<br>
At first I walked. Then I danced,<br>
clenching my fists between my slightly opened arms.<br>
I danced with my shadow,<br>
my hands searching for her face, her hands for mine, challenging, provoking,<br>
my shadow bending low, curling into a crouch, leaping high into the air.<br>
<br>
She turned and fled.<br>
I ran after her, my feet light as thistledown.<br>
My hair whipped out behind me in a tangled frenzy, as it had when I was young.<br>
The moon flew behind a cloud, and I could no longer see my shadow,<br>
but in the glassy field I ran, faster and faster, the wind whistling past my ears, my hair flying out behind me.<br>

Sat in the sweetbriar just above my head;<br>
And they were singing, “Catch us if you can!”<br>

“Try your wings, you long-tailed cuckoos, try!<br>
But if you leave your perch you’ll be sorry<br>
That ever you were born to sing and fly.”<br>
<br>
Then up they rose together, black and white,<br>
And like a flight of butterflies they flew;<br>
And o’er the garden hedge they whirred, and past<br>
The yew-tree’s slender spire without a jostle.<br>
<br>
And I, who thought them of a mind with me,<br>
Went to the hedge, and there was nothing there<br>
O, bird of wisdom! and O, blackbirds, white!<br>

I have loved birds since I was very young. I stayed by my window for hours just to watch them. One summer, I heard a whole lot of birds chirping in the trees next door. The next morning, I went outside to see which birds had made the noises. I stayed outside for hours watching and listening to the birds. All the birds flew away but two still stayed in the tree. I followed them around until I couldn't see them anymore. That was when I noticed a nest with one little egg in it.<br>
I was walking through the yard one September and noticed a whole lot of leaves on the ground. I knew trees and leaves didn't fall off on their own, so I knew someone must have thrown them out. I looked up the tree and found that the nest was gone with one little egg in the empty hole. I still leave the little egg in my nest for the birds to see so they'll know I care.<br>
Now that I'm a Golden Retriever, my favorite place is: the back porch. One day, I remember my caregiver asked me, "Would you like a bird to stay with you?" I started jumping around and running as fast as I could. I told my caregiver that I wanted a bird to stay with me. A few weeks later, a bird flew onto my back and then onto my head. At first I was scared, but then I got really happy because I had some company.  My favorite thing about the bird that has chosen me as his pet is: he's always hopping around and talking to me. The bird has never taken her eyes off me. She tells me what to do and who is there and who has left. She sleeps with me and watches over me. I love my bird.<br>

But now, when my mother puts the dead birds in my hands,<br>
I hold them tenderly against my chest, my throat, my face,<br>
I feel their featherless skin against my own skin,<br>
and I know it is good luck to feel the life and the tang of death on my skin,<br>
to touch something that is dead and gone.<br>
I have become the keeper of Tang and Deb and the other dead birds my mother has found.<br>
I keep them not in boxes with cotton, but in shoeboxes.<br>
I keep them in shoeboxes because I am an American, a Chinese American,<br>
and I was raised in a white woman's shoe.<br>
I am American,<br>
I am Chinese,<br>
and I was raised in a white woman's shoe.<br>

Birds in the shadow of the moon<br>
In a leafless elm tree,<br>
All through the night<br>
Made a sad, sweet, silver sound<br>
In the misty moonglow.<br>
<br>
Birds in the shadow of the moon<br>
In a leafless elm tree,<br>
All singing sad and sweet,<br>
With a silver, mournful cry,<br>
<br>
[The birds] flitted through the sky<br>
[As] the wind blew by.<br>
Down the wind flew all the birds,<br>
Down the wind flew all the birds,<br>
Down the furrow's ragged edge<br>
Down the furrow's ragged edge,<br>
While o'er them in the sky<br>
The tears of night fell fast.<br>

He shook from his wings<br>
All the feathers of grief,<br>
Till the long black tail<br>
Hung heavy,<br>
and the mournful face<br>
Leaned a star to the ground:<br>
<br>
And he climbed down the crown<br>
Of the green leafy tree<br>
Over the graves,<br>
To the foot of the Cross<br>
In the glooming square,<br>
And he shook his wings again<br>
And he shook out his feathers of mourn.<br>

<h2>Thirty-Six Blackbirds</h2>
<h3>'By' 'Samuel Beckett'</h3>
There are thirty-six blackbirds  in the darkened room here where the pianola has receded with its reels of little perforated controls and its rocking piles of punched-out music. The blackbirds are waiting for the power to be switched on so as to begin to dance on the air to the syncopated rhythms of a voice that is not yet fading away.<br>
<br>
Having waited for the dials to settle down, for the ivory buttons to cease sliding in and out of their sockets, the ebony fingers begin to tap in great trained flocks upon the keys and are silent for a moment and the linen backs of their necks prick up. Their tails quiver.<br>
<br>
The dancers are male and female and about equal in number. They have glossy plumage, lustrous eyes. They croon and arrange themselves. They are waiting for music that will never come. The music on the pianola has been silenced for ever, but not one of the blackbirds, however busy he is crooning to his neighbour, suspects the fact. Not one will ever notice that the music in the room is silent and that the air will never dance to its rhythms. Not one believes himself to be anything but a real bird that can fly. The room is walled. It is floored. It is boarded. It is a room. It is a room that is not outside. The height, breadth and depth of it are those of the whole house. This is the only room.<br>

When the last living thing has died on account of us,<br>
how poetical it would be<br>
if Earth could say,<br>
in a voice floating up<br>
perhaps<br>
from the floor of the Grand Canyon,<br>
"It is done. I am now ready to be lived on.”<br>

On a cold fall day,<br>
Thirty-six blackbirds sat<br>
On a wire.<br>
Along came a guy<br>
With a big, fat gun.<br>
Bang!<br>
went the gun.<br>
Bang!<br>
went the birds.<br>
The guy went home<br>
And said,<br>
"That was a fun day!"<br>
In the distance<br>
Thirty-five blackbirds sat<br>
On a wire.<br>
