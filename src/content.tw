<p>If you've never used Twine before, it might be helpful to orient yourself before you dive into the text. There are two primary interface panels: the sidebar and the top bar. The sidebar allows you to save, load, and restart your readthrough, jump to a section, review this guide, jump to the glossary, or go to your bookmarks. The top bar lets you go back, bookmark your current passage, or go forward. There are also links embedded within the text of each passage that you can click through to.</p>

<p>The most linear path forward is to begin with the [[Introduction->Introduction 1]], which sets up most of my concerns. However, you can also jump into one of the three sections, each of which contains several case studies. These sections are organized conceptually, like chapters: the [[first->Section 1: GESTURE]] focuses on embodied social gestures as they are mediated technologically, with a focus on mediated maternity and paternity; the [[second->Section 2: MEMORY]] turns to cognition that takes place on and around technological platforms; the [[third->Section 3: PRACTICE]] brings these two concepts together in a discussion of my practice-based research. If you're wondering why I would write a dissertation in Twine, the introduction to the third section is a good place to start. If you'd prefer to begin with terms rather than case studies, the [[glossary->Glossary]] features a list of all defined terms. Similarly, you can look at the [[bibliography->Bibliography]] to see what thinkers and text have informed my thinking.</p>

<p>Throughout, you can use the links on the sidebar to jump to a particular section. You can also bookmark a given passage with the bookmark button on the bottom of each passage. This will save a link to your Bookmarks page, which you can access through your sidebar. </p>

<p>The dissertation uses a color-coded system to let you know what you're getting into when you click a link. <span style="color: #48B44A;">Definitions are green</span>, <span style="color:#E76428;">excerpts are orange</span>, <span style="color:#9E9E9E;">citations are grey</span>, and other <span style="color:#68d;">links are blue</span>.

One of the first things Hiro Protagonist, the main character of Neal Stephenson‚Äôs 1992 cyberpunk novel <i>Snow Crash</i>, sees when he drops into the Metaverse is two young couples out on a date. "[Hiro] is not," Stephenson amends, "seeing real people, of course [‚Ä¶] the people are pieces of software called avatars. They are the audiovisual bodies that people use to communicate with each other in the Metaverse" 4(4). In <i>Snow Crash</i>‚Äôs cyberpunk virtual-reality version of the internet, one‚Äôs avatar is a status symbol whose value lies in its ability to echo ‚Äì or voice ‚Äì one‚Äôs identity; as a hacker, Hiro goes for verisimilitude because "it takes a lot more sophistication to render a realistic human face" (45). The couples, on the other hand, "can‚Äôt afford to have custom avatars made and don‚Äôt know how to write their own," so they‚Äôre stuck with "off-the-shelf avatars" (45). Hiro‚Äôs attention is focused on the two girls, whose avatars get detailed descriptions.

Twenty-six years after the publication of <i>Snow Crash</i>, 10.7 million players logged onto the video game Fortnite on February 2, 2019 to watch DJ Marshmello perform a 10-minute concert (Webster 2019). Although Fortnite is primarily a first-person online shooter, Marshmello‚Äôs performance on a custom, violence-free server accentuated the ‚Äòreality‚Äô of this virtual co-inhabited space. Marshmello opened the show by shouting, "What is up Pleasant Park! Thank you for coming out today and making history today!" and urged his audience to participate: "Let me see everybody moving!" (Marshmello 2019). ‚ÄòMoving,‚Äô in this context, means making use of any of the 189 ‚Äòdances‚Äô, also called emotes, available for purchase on the Epic Store; indeed, over the course of the concert, Marshmallo exhorted the attendees to "do their favorite emote" in time with a bass drop, and "Let [him] see that Marsh Walk"‚Äì a [[$5-8->V-Bucks]] emote based on his signature dance move.

These emotes, along with the hundreds of avatars (called ‚Äòoutfits‚Äô), toys, and other cosmetic add-ons on sale, account for Fortnite‚Äôs estimated two billion dollars in profit last year. While Fortnite is free to play, a player who chooses not to purchase any gestures or outfits is randomly assigned a new avatar with a random race and a random gender every time they start a game, and cannot express themselves via emote.  Like in <i>Snow Crash</i>, a player‚Äôs ability to pay determines their ability to express themselves, and even a rich player‚Äôs expressive range is limited to the gestures that the developers have motion-captured and programmed into the game. In Fortnite and in the Metaverse, the modes of social performance possible depend on the technological medium on which they are performed.

This situation is a microcosm of the broader condition of living in the information age, when memes rub shoulders with selfies, confessions, poems, and listicles on an online commons where humans near-constantly perform themselves into being on virtual stages. This dissertation takes as its starting question the moment when a human impulse is translated, transcoded, or transmediated onto a technological medium for dissemination, and considers how [[information->Information]], as a term that can describe both the human gesture and its technological afterlife, might help us describe that moment. I take as my primary object of study modern and contemporary drama and fiction, with a secondary interest in the technological afterlives of those objects, because those objects show a persistent concern with the process of technologization that the human gesture undergoes, and the kind of subject that that process produces. 

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Introduction 5">><</silently>>

:: Introduction 5 [intro nobr] {"position":"1026,1652","size":"100,100"}
The texts I read here stage the transmediation of the human subject onto technological substrates. I will consider the human subject as a pattern of related information that embodies itself in a variety of different media, both techno- and bio-logical. Focusing specifically on those moments in literary texts where a transmediation of the self takes place will help me isolate the (informational) signal that persists through this process. I see these moments as especially crucial in an historical moment where the social gestures through which we act ourselves into being are increasingly mediated on technological substrates. I call this process informational performativity, or "<<define "informativity" "information and selfhood">>," and believe that drama, as a <<define "genre">> fundamentally concerned with the problems of performance, will best allow me to articulate it.

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Introduction 6">><</silently>>


:: Introduction 6 [intro nobr] {"position":"1025,1802","size":"100,100"}
The texts I‚Äôve chosen stage these informational remediations of the self; just as importantly, the process that leads to a particular production of a play involves multiple more or less discrete transmediations that demonstrate the problems that come with a model of selfhood that depends on materially contingent media. One powerful way of thinking through these problems is performance theory. Judith Butler‚Äôs work on performative gestures and identity formation form an important conceptual bridge between [[information and selfhood]]. By coupling a kind of performative existentialism, whereby we are what we do, with the reflexive relationship between form and medium learned from media studies from Marshall McLuhan forward, I will argue that what we do depends on the media through which we do it, and therefore who we are depends on the media through which we interface with ourselves and the broader social world. By this logic, if a large proportion of the social gestures we perform are embodied and disseminated on technological substrates‚Äîif the body we stylize is the body electric‚Äîthen the self that arises will be inflected by those technological substrates.

:: Introduction 7 [intro nobr] {"position":"1023,1952","size":"100,100"}
We must, however, challenge any supposition that suggests a purer, truer self that exists prior to its embodiment and expression; instead, I argue that theorizing identity through informativity allows for greater focus on the way that who we are changes when our gestures are embodied technologically. Understanding these modes of performing the self into being requires understanding what is gained and what is lost when thought is given flesh, and when that embodied thought is translated, transmediated, (or, to borrow Lev Manovich‚Äôs term) transcoded into digital form. In short, using information as a term to pinpoint the pattern that is translated and embedded into new material contexts will allow me to trace the remediations of the self that are undergone in the information age.

If the human subject can be meaningfully parsed as an informational pattern embodied on a variety of media, both biological and technological, a literary text can be even more naturally parsed informationally. Indeed, most literary texts we read in the 21st century spend at least some of their time as ones and zeroes, electrical variances on a spinning disks: in forms that are ordinarily thought of as informational. Even the fetishized paper book, which arguably remains  a better medium for some kinds of reading, is often written and edited on a word processor, typecast in LaTex, and sold online. Under this informational paradigm, the ink on the physical page that is ultimately produced is the data that must be decoded and made meaningful by the reader. Both the subject and object of the literary event can be conceptualized as informational, and using information as a common term between the reader and the text makes possible a theory of reading that illuminates the porous relationship between the reader and the text.

This computational mode of parsing the process of reading grows more complex, if starker, on the stage, where the word used for the playtext is the same as the word programmers use for small programs: a script, to be executed more or less faithfully. A playwright like Caryl Churchill, who often wrote in workshop settings in collaboration with her actors, might make the pun on script seem less active. Conversely, Samuel Beckett demanded absolute control over his actors: to take one example, he asked during the rehearsals for the 1957 premi√©re production of Endgame that "a certain phrase which occurs throughout the text be spoken in exactly the same way each time with the same tone, like a note of music played in an invariable way by the same instrument" (Blin in Simpson 2015).

My practice-based research, which takes Beckett‚Äôs already hyperdetermined Quad and transcodes it using the video game engine Unity, replaces the actors with computer-generated models animated by motion-capture data as a way of carrying out this absolute control to its (un)natural endpoint, a technologizing process that necessarily comes with its own gains and losses. There is, then, a continuum of contingency that comes into the process of stage production and of remediation more broadly. One task of this dissertation will be to look at a variety of informational remediations and examine the contingencies attendant upon them as they appear in literary works. Doing so will help me articulate the conditions under which people living in the information age perform themselves into being. Further, this framework also offers a way of reading modern and contemporary plays that uses information as a common term to explicate the complex processes of translation and mediation that take place between an author‚Äôs idea and an audience‚Äôs reception of an embodied performance.

:: Introduction 11 [intro nobr] {"position":"1023,2552","size":"100,100"}
This dissertation takes up drama as well as fiction and works of electronic literature in service of a larger argument about the fate of <<define "genre">> in the information age. The genre of a text is necessarily impacted by the particularity of its medium: in Beckett‚Äôs case, we can think about his insistence on the distinction between his plays, his teleplays, and his radio plays, and the slippage between ‚Äòmedium of transmission‚Äô and ‚Äògenre‚Äô that this distinction suggests. One function of the technological mediation of the literary at this point in the information age, however, is to collapse disparate genres and forms under the broader umbrella of ‚Äòcontent,‚Äô a genre that includes social media posts, news articles, videos, podcasts, and a plethora of other information streams. The medium of the Internet puts personal expression like status updates alongside Samuel Beckett quotations and news stories. By placing the two in the same context, on the same stream, the medium invites its users to read the two as members of the same genre. Reified social gestures become legible as texts, and vice versa.

Take, for example, the satire website Clickhole‚Äôs ‚Äòblog post‚Äô "The Time I Spent On A Commercial Whaling Ship Totally Changed My Perspective On The World," credited to "Ishmael - Sailor," whose title sits on a page above an image of a whale‚Äôs tail and the nearly unabridged text of <i>Moby Dick</i>. The article‚Äôs clickbait title recontextualizes the <<define "heterogeneric">> Great American Novel as bloggy self-expression. As Ryu Spaeth puts it in an article for The New Republic, the joke is that "even the greatest American Novel, digressions and weirdness and all, becomes vapid garbage as soon as it meets the internet" (2015). What Spaeth‚Äôs jeremiad misses is the way that Moby Dick already anticipates a collapsing of multiple genres into a single spout of content. That Clickhole omits the "Extracts" section that precedes "Call me Ishmael," however, is ironic; Melville‚Äôs Sub-Sub-Librarian‚Äôs collection of "higgledy-piggledy whale statements" collected from the "long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth" ‚Äì vapid garbage indeed! ‚Äì anticipates the aggregation and list generation that makes up so much of the content on the web. This dissertation takes up multiple genres to explore the relationship of the literary and the informational for the same reason Ishmael takes up multiple genres to describe the White Whale: the subject exceeds any one way of looking at it and can at best be imperfectly grasped.

No conclusions just yet, but I'll arrive at some in time, I'm sure.


:: Section 1 Introduction [nobr]
<p>These three case studies are unified by a concern with the way that context and medium shape the possible meanings of a gesture.</p>
<p>The first of these, "A Play Infected with a Virus": Signal, Noise, and the Glitch in Caryl Churchill's <i>Blue Kettle</i>, examines Caryl Churchill's play <i>Blue Kettle</i>, where the staged disintegration of language into syntactically meaningless but nevertheless semantically (and emotionally) comprehensible <<define "utterances" "utterance">> highlights the dynamic of <<define "signal">>, <<define "noise">>, and <span class="glitch" data-text="glitch">glitch</span> that conditions any <<define "transcoded" "transcoding">> gesture.</p>
<p>The second, "I Have Weird Ideas About What It Means To Be A Man": Oughties Multimedia Masculinity in <i>Achewood</i>, explores how the multimedial, <<define "heterogeneric">> structure of Chris Onstad's webcoming <i>Achewood</i> takes advantage of its protean media to critique and queer the tropes and gestures that constituted masculinity in a particular space and time online.</p>
<p>The third and final case study, "Skin and Air": Remediation and Power in <i>Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</i>, considers how historical contingencies such as race and gender condition the relationship between August Wilson's fictionalized blueswoman Ma Rainey and the recording technologies that exploitative white men use to capture and sell her voice - and how the actual Ma Rainey's stage and gender performance undermines this black-body-white-technological binary.</p>
<p>The goal of this section is to articulate and demonstrate a theory of gesture that works within the framework of <<define "informativity" "information and selfhood ">>. Each case study aims to show how the specificity of the medium and the technologies of that medium - the stages, URLs, and records - condition the possible selves that can be acted into being, and how the glitches and gaps in the tropes of that media offer the opportunity to productively queer those possibilities.</p>

<p>[[Caryl Churchill]]‚Äôs <i>Blue Kettle</i> is one half of a pair of one-act plays first produced and performed in Edinburgh and London in 1997; it received its American premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York on January 27th, 1999, just about one year away from the ‚Äòapocalypse‚Äô virus [[Y2K]]. The plot of <i>Blue Kettle</i> is simple: a shabby con man, Derek, tricks five different elderly women into believing that he‚Äôs the long-lost son that each of them gave up for adoption in their youth. That is, he‚Äôs discovered that each woman gave up a child when they were younger, and he pretends to be their son, for reasons obscure to both the audience and Derek himself. This plot, however, is in Churchill‚Äôs own words "a [[McGuffin]]." Churchill‚Äôs main intention towards the play, she writes in her foreword to the fourth volume of her collected drama, "was [its] destruction." <<cite "viii" "Churchill, Caryl. Churchill Plays: 4">></p>

<p>The agent of this destruction is what she calls a "[[virus]]": over the course of the play, the words that make up the dialogue begin to be replaced, with increasing frequency, with either the word "blue" or the word "kettle." This begins in the second scene, where Derek says "You don‚Äôt have to <<blue "mess">> anything up"; by the fifth scene, we have lines like "I can't <<blue "put">> it back in. What if they don‚Äôt <<blue "love">> me any <<blue "more">>?" By the end of the play, the infection is complete, and even "blue" and "kettle have been replaced by their constitutive parts: Mrs. Plant‚Äôs final line, "<span class="kettle">T</span> <span class="blue">b</span> <span class="kettle">k k k k l</span>?", is responded to, with appropriate finality, with Derek‚Äôs "<span class="blue">B</span>. <span class="kettle">K.</span>"</p>

Contemporary reviews of the play were positive, if occasionally befuddled, but returned again and again to the metaphor of a "linguistic virus" to describe the proliferation of "<<blue blue>>" and "<<kettle kettle>>" through the dialogue - a good decade before Churchill herself used it in the aforequoted foreword. Matt Wolf‚Äôs review for American Theater states that the play "concerns the breakdown of language - words and letters as a sort of virus that by play‚Äôs end have made a mockery of meaning" <<cite "1" "Wolf, Matt. True Blue and Dreamy">>; Charles McNulty‚Äôs review for the Village Voice is titled "Language is a Virus" and suggests that "the linguistic equivalent of the [[Y2K]] virus spreads insidiously" through the play <<cite "1" "McNulty, Charles. Language is a Virus">>; and Gerard Raymond, also writing for The Village Voice, notes that Max Stafford-Clark, the play‚Äôs director, refers to the "language virus" as the heart of the play <<cite "1" "Raymond, Gerard. Play and Anti-Play">>. Contemporary criticism has been similarly invested in the metaphor of the virus, but - like the reviews - has done little to consider the metaphor‚Äôs implications.

<<define "Viruses" "virus">> can be broken up into three categories, more or less: a biological virus, like <<define "influenza">> or <<define "COVID-19">>, a computer virus, like <<define "ILOVEYOU">> or STUXNET, and a viral idea, or a <<define "meme">>. What these three sets of phenomena have in common is a focus on replication: a biological virus hijacks a cell‚Äôs machinery so that it replicates the virus rather than itself, a computer virus hijacks its host computer so that it replicates infected files, and a meme - closest to a linguistic virus - propagates and spreads across information networks via replication and both live in and constitute the minds of its hosts.

<p>Let's focus on these technological senses rather than the biological, in part because those critics who have remarked on the figure of the virus in Churchill‚Äôs work have done so in reference to her persistent interest in genetics (her most performed play, <i>A Number</i>, is a meditation on cloning, and her play <i>[[Love and Information]]</i> has a ‚Äòscene‚Äô that‚Äôs [[nothing but a DNA sequence spoken out loud)->GENE]].  Indeed, biological replication comes up in <i>Blue Kettle</i> itself, when Derek converses with one of his marks, Mrs. Oliver, about family:</p>
<blockquote>
<span class = "script">MRS OLIVER:	Do you believe in heredity?</span><br>
<span class = "script">DEREK: 		A bit.</span><<cite "103" "Churchill, Caryl. Blue Kettle">>
</blockquote>
<p>The same scene goes on, however, to discuss something closer to the memetic version of replication:</p>
<blockquote>
<span class = "script">MRS OLIVER:	But then there‚Äôs how you‚Äôre brought up. There‚Äôs family jokes.</span><br>
<span class = "script">DEREK: 	Exactly.</span><br>
<span class = "script">MRS OLIVER:	I mean I look at you and you could be anyone.<<cite "103" "Churchill, Caryl. Blue Kettle">></span>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinking about "<span class="blue">blue</span> <span class = "kettle">kettle</span>" as a kind of computer virus suggests a way of reading the play with information theory - and that reading provides a provocative vocabulary for considering the mediation between sense and nonsense that the play stages. </p>

:: Blue Kettle 5 [bk nobr] {"position":"1870,1905","size":"100,100"}
<p>This mode of informationally-informed reading, which I‚Äôm tentatively calling "literary informatics", considers the literary text as a kind of code, a bundle of information written by the author and executed by the reader. It opens up a usefully novel mode of considering the process by which the literary text becomes the phenomenological experience of the audience. </p>
<p>The naive schematic for this mode of reading is as follows: the playwright has a scene they imagine on stage. That image is transcoded, or remediated, into words, which are then printed onto the page of a script. Because exhaustively describing the full scenario to appear on stage would take pages and pages, the playwright compresses the totality of a scenario into dialogue, words on a page that are then expanded upon by the director and the actors. Sometimes there are more or less precise stage directions to guide that expansion, but <i>Blue Kettle</i> has none. R. Darren Gobart‚Äôs biological reading of the play, which focuses on DNA rather than on computer code, centers the fact that "performance provides the supplement that brings the textual DNA to theatrical life"<<cite "120" "Gobart, R. Darren. 'On Performance and Selfhood in Caryl Churchill'">>; a computational heuristic, however, foregrounds the role of the audience member in decoding and expanding the ultimate ‚Äòmessage‚Äô of the play.</p>

<p>How does that decoding take place? </p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with the experience of reading rather than the experience of seeing the play on a stage. The initial substitutions do not significantly impede the reader‚Äôs ability to understand what‚Äôs going on; a good portion of the substitutions in the first half of the play are made wholly comprehensible in their context, either by local repetition or recognition of <<define "clich√©" "clich√©">> .</p>

<p>In the case of local repetition, one speaker will say something that‚Äôs been garbled by the virus, and their interlocutor will respond with a variation on the same sentence without its having been garbled. Importatnly, the characters understand one another‚Äôs _words_ perfectly, even if they understand one another‚Äôs (and their own) intentions but dimly. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
	<span class="script">DEREK: 	So <<blue "why">>didn‚Äôt anyone let you know?</span><br>
	<span class="script">ENID:	Why do you think?</span><<cite "105" "Churchill, Caryl. Blue Kettle">>
</blockquote>

<p>Enid‚Äôs question in response to Derek‚Äôs question suggests that "blue" stands here for "why", and the sentence is intelligible as "So why didn‚Äôt anyone let you know." Redundancy preserves intelligibility - although redundancy is the first thing omitted in most digital compression algorithms. These moments, too, replicate the process by which a virus replicates: it hijacks existing text.</p>

<p>The recognition of <<define "clich√©s" "clich√©">> and idioms is another cognitive algorithm that the reader can use to decode the text. Phrases like:</p>
<blockquote>
MRS VANE: 		I burnt all the letters and the two photographs. I made a clean <<blue break>>.<<cite "108" "Churchill, Caryl. Blue Kettle">>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
MRS VANE:		That‚Äôs good. So can we fix a <<blue date>> to do that?<<cite "110" "Churchill, Caryl. Blue Kettle">>

<p>both invoke the reader‚Äôs familiarity with well-worn phrases to fill in the gaps. The replacement of "break" with "blue," however, defamiliarizes the clich√©, and the process of decoding the garbled language acts as a kind of productive friction that forces a reader to dwell on moments in the text that might otherwise be glossed over. Further, the specific replacements that take place - that is, ‚Äòa clean blue‚Äô for ‚Äòa clean break‚Äô - necessarily plays on whatever associations the reader has with the word ‚Äòblue‚Äô - cleanliness, water, sadness, whatever.</p>

These modes of decoding, alongside things like learned <<define "genre">>-savviness from having read other plays with similar arcs and a general understanding of how conversation tends to work, makes it possible for a careful reader to, with some difficulty, pick out a signal out of the virus‚Äôs noise. An audience member has a much easier time; as most of the contemporary reviews make clear, the fact that human bodies on stage are gesticulating and emoting along with their fragmented language - and the fact that performing or reading the lines aloud requires having a sense of what words have been replaced - makes the lines‚Äô meanings much easier to comprehend. Reading the quotations aloud sends this into sharp relief.

Even by the eleventh and final scene, an exchange like: <blockquote><span class="script">DEREK: 		<<ket She Tle>> died <<ket when ket>> I <<ket ket was>> a child.</span>
<span class="script">MRS PLANT:		<<bl Is Bl>> <<bl that bl>> <<ket supposed ket>> <<bl to b>> <<bl be b>> <<bl an b>> excuse?</span>
<span class="script">DEREK:		<<ket If Ket>> <<bl you b>> like. Or not.</span><<cite "128" "Churchill, Caryl. Blue Kettle">></blockquote>is mostly comprehensible.

<p>That process of decoding - a sort of second kind of reading - forces the reader to translate from a language they don‚Äôt know. More intriguingly, it suggests that the translation isn‚Äôt necessary: that the particular words might not matter, and that "<<bl Is Bl>> <<bl that bl>> <<ket supposed ket>> <<bl to b>> <<bl be b>> <<bl an b>> excuse?" is instead understandable in its garbled form. The implication, then, is that words are interchangeable so long as the plots are simple enough and the meanings they‚Äôre meant to convey are common enough to infer. If the text is generically stable, then the language becomes less important; meaning operates like the <<define "Ship of Theseus">>, with successively more pieces removed without changing the text.</p>
<p>This becomes especially interesting in light of the play‚Äôs plot, <<define "McGuffin">> or not: Derek attempts, over and over again, to supplement his mother, who suffers from advanced dementia and whose dialogue, when she appears, seems to be infected with a linguistic virus of another type:</p>
<blockquote>
DEREK: I'm finding all these <<blue old>> <<kettle women>> and <<kettle pretending>> to be their long lost son.<br>
MOTHER: You didn't find me when I got lost in the garden and Mrs Molesworth says Look behind you, look behind you what could it be, what's going on behind me, I <<blue hear>> a shriek, what's behind me what's behind me.<br>
DEREK: And what was it?<br>
MOTHER: Sorry, <<blue love>>, what did you <<blue say>>?<<cite "119" "Churchill, Caryl. Blue Kettle">>
</blockquote>
<p>Derek's mother's linguistic issues are different in kind from the more general linguistic virus; she appears to be lost in distant memories and is unable to have a conversation with her son. Unlike the conversations later in the text, which can generally be followed despite the blues and the kettles, this conversation is verbally sound but lacks both sense and an emotional connection.</p>
<p>He replaces her with more emotionally available women; if he ultimately succeeds with Mrs. Plant, he does so at the expense of his words. However, if she understands him, he understands her, and we (more or less) understand both of them, that may not be much of a loss. We‚Äôre all still playing the same <<excerpt "language game." "Language Game">> Hence, perhaps, Churchill‚Äôs tongue-in-cheek admission that <i>Blue Kettle</i> was a failure as an anti-play, and that it would have succeeded only if it went on for another two scenes, staging a true-blue disintegration of meaning that neither the reader nor the audience could comprehend.</p>

<p>Along those lines, we will turn to the information theoretical binary of <<define "signal" "Signal">> and <<define "noise." "Noise">></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say I want to send a voice message to you. I take out my phone, I record the message, and I send it to you via, say, <a href = "http://m.me/kenneth.alba" target = "_blank"> Messenger</a>. What I aim for you to get is the signal - the words I‚Äôm saying or sounds I‚Äôm making. All of the extraneous stuff - the unwanted modifications that the signal suffers during capture, storage, transmission, processing, or conversion - is noise. In this context, it might be a car horn from outside, some static because of the <<define "lossy" "Loss">> compression algorithm Facebook uses for audio files in the interest of bandwidth conservation, or any number of other things.</p>

<p>The binary gets used in a much broader context online, where web forum administrators might call on-topic posts the ‚Äòsignal‚Äô and off-topic distractions ‚Äònoise‚Äô. Email spam might be thought of as noise in opposition to the Important emails that your client might tag for you. Critically, the opposition presumes both a sender and a receiver that is capable of processing information - of making ‚Äòsense‚Äô of the message, and of having an intentional stance towards that message that makes the signal meaningful and the noise meaningless. This is a distinction worth bringing up inasmuch as the language of information theory, and of technology more broadly, is often given a kind of epistemological primacy that sidesteps questions of bias and imbues its object with an aura of objectivity. </p>

<p>In the context of this play, then, we might think about the virus as a deliberate introduction of noise into an otherwise clear signal. As the infection grows, the signal becomes more and more muddled, until (on the page, at least) there‚Äôs nothing but noise. The cognitive work of making sense of the play is the work of noise reduction - of working around the infected language to arrive at the real, important meaning underneath. Importantly, the framework of ‚Äòsignal‚Äô and ‚Äònoise‚Äô implies just this sort of reader, one that can convert raw data into meaningful information. The signal, under this framework, is the stuff the receiver cares about; the noise is interference. That the play‚Äôs plot is merely a <<define "McGuffin">> and the virus is the point of the play, however, gestures to the provisional and contingent division of signal from noise.</p>

If <i>Blue Kettle</i>'s plot is unimportant and its purpose is its own destruction, then the message being imparted from Churchill is the virus itself: in which case, the formal disintegration of the play is itself the signal, and the plot, along with the messy emotions of the characters in it, are noise that gradually clears away. I‚Äôd like to suggest that neither of these situations quite describes the play, and that the oscillation between the two - the formal experimentation and the emotional impact - is a particular aesthetic moment where the reader/audience flips between two modes of comprehending the text. The moment where signal becomes noise and vice versa is one I‚Äôd like to call the <<define "glitch" "Glitch">>, following [[Ross Menkman‚Äôs 2010 Glitch Studies Manifesto->Ross Menkman‚Äôs 2010 Glitch Studies Manifesto]].

I would like, however, to argue, that the aesthetic experience of the <span class="glitch" data-text="glitch">glitch</span> is not merely a binary flip of signal to noise and vice versa; instead, what interests me is the kind of limbo that the medial scenes in "Blue Kettle" put forward. Much like Kant‚Äôs description of the cognitive process of apprehending beauty in the [[Critique of Judgment]], my understanding of the <span class="glitch" data-text="glitch">glitch</span> is that moment of free-play between the attempt to distinguish meaning from the message and the experience of the image - or text - as itself, incapable of being boiled down into a coherent meaning. A sufficiently <span class="glitch" data-text="glitch">glitched</span> image gestures towards the thing that the unglitched version of the image might convey, but the visual signifiers of infection - the distortion, the lines, and so forth - are the point of the image, much like how the destruction of <i>Blue Kettle</i> is, for Churchill, the point of the play.

<p>Caryl Churchill‚Äôs later work, particularly her 2012 play <i>[[Love and Information]]</i>, deals more squarely with the technological dissemination and corruption of human words and gestures via information technology, and with the potentially alienating consequences of that transmediation. The 2020s are an era where the social gestures we use to constitute ourselves in relation to one another are increasingly mediated on technological substrates, and where the words we use are increasingly infected with viral language from Twitter and so forth. As Patricia Lockwood puts it in her essay about the Internet titled "The Communal Mind":</p>
<blockquote>But worth remembering: the mind had been, in its childhood, a place of play.<br>
It had also once been the place where you sounded like yourself. Gradually it had become the place where we sounded like each other, through some erosion of wind or water on a self not nearly as firm as stone.<br><<cite "*" "Lockwood, Patricia. The Communal Mind.">>
</blockquote>
<p>Calvin Kasulke's 2021 novel <i>Several People Are Typing</i> explores similar territory; an epistolary novel set in a workplace's Slack server, it features a plotline where emojis - and, eventually, fragments of <<define "emojis" "emoji">> - replace language altogether, culminating in two characters breaking off a relationship thusly:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Churchill‚Äôs exploration of a "language virus" in <i>Blue Kettle</i> suggests a potential form of resistance: by flipping the script, and by reconsidering what is signal and what is noise in the messages we receive, we can reconsider the contingencies inherent in the technologies that‚Äôre transmitting those messages. In the same way that "Blue Kettle" forces the reader to ‚Äòdecode‚Äô the semantic content of a phrase denuded of meaningful signifiers, we can reconsider and try to decode the content of language that we - and others - use that‚Äôs become totally infected with commonplace viral language - the "sames", emojis, "big moods" and "on brands" of living in the information age.</p>

<p>In 2007, Lev Grossman, writing for Time Magazine, named Chris Onstad‚Äôs webcomic <i>Achewood</i> the year‚Äôs best graphic novel, despite it not being a graphic novel in ‚Äúevery, or maybe any, traditional sense, since its primary venue is on the web.‚Äù<<cite "*" "Grossman, Lev. ''Top 10 Graphic Novels.'">> <i>Achewood</i> was a long-running webcomic by that point; Onstad published more than 2600 strips, mostly between 2001 and 2010, during a run that earned it a place on the AV Club‚Äôs list of Best Comics of the 00‚Äôs.<<cite "*" "Heller, Jason, et al.

<p>Like most works under examination in this document, <i>Achewood</i> is a difficult work to summarize or sort generically; in Grossman‚Äôs words, it:</p>
<blockquote>
defies categorization or description, but a brief, futile effort at a synopsis might look something like this: A bunch of cats, some robots, a bear and an otter who's 5 years old, live together in a fictional neighborhood called Achewood, which you might usefully think of as a grown-up, suburban, stoned version of Pooh's Hundred Acre Wood. <<cite "*" "Grossman, Lev.

<p>What makes <i>Achewood</i> interesting from the perspective of <<define "informativity" "information and selfhood">> is its vast array of <<define "paratexts" "paratext">> written in the voice and from the perspective of Onstad‚Äôs characters. In addition to the webcomic, Onstad has written:</p>

<p>Exactly one of the twelve blogs is written by a female character, and the strip itself is similarly focused on men. The subject matter of all of this material is in many ways diverse - it‚Äôs certainly strange - but the central fixation is what it means to be a man in the 2000s.</p>

<p>What <i>Achewood</i>‚Äôs <<define "heterogeneric">>, <<define "multimedial">> form reflects is its attitude towards masculinity as a fragmentary, discontinuous performance. The self-conscious utilization of multiple genera makes possible the presentation of a collection of characters who themselves already represent non-traditional forms of masculinity not merely as punch-lines but as fully fleshed-out and sympathetic fictional subjects.</p>
<p>Take Teodor, an anxious bear whose main passion is cooking, or Lyle, the alcoholic tiger with a talent for calligraphy, both of whose blogs reflect their respective passions. By disseminating its male characters‚Äô interiorities across a variety of digital media, <i>Achewood</i> offers a model of what I‚Äôm calling "multimedia masculinity". This model is of particular interest - and has particular explanatory power - in a contemporary moment where gender performance is increasingly multimedial and fragmented - strewn across multiple social media platforms, Zooms, and other pages as much as it is embodied and in person.</p>

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Achewood 4">><</silently>>

<p>What do I mean by multimedia masculinity? The term takes as its point of departure Judith Butler‚Äôs insight that gender is a socially constructed system of norms that must be constantly performed and prescriptively regulated to maintain its illusion of stability - a</p>
<blockquote>
	repeated stylization of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the appearance of substance<<cite "33" "Butler, Judith. Gender Trouble.">>.
</blockquote>
<p>However, this contemporary moment, where ‚Äòembodiment‚Äô is dematerialized to an unprecedented extent, warrants a close consideration of what ‚Äòbodies‚Äô are stylized to produce the appearance of a gendered substance. Considering masculinity from a multimedial perspective means doing just this: thinking about the different platforms, like social media, through and on which social gestures are performed.</p>

<p>Multimedia masculinity, then, is a way of thinking about masculinity as it is performed through the bodies electric: in Facebook posts and tweets, on MMOs and Slack servers. Gender in this mode of thinking becomes something akin to <<define "genre">>; as Lauren Berlant puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
	To call an identity like a sexual identity a genre is to think about it as something repeated, detailed, and stretched while retaining its intelligibility, its capacity to remain readable or audible across the field of all its variations <<cite "4" "Berlant, Lauren. The Female Complaint.">>
</blockquote>
<p><<define "Medium" "medium">> - or platform - vary, and inflect both gender and genre, so the kinds of masculinity that these different media make possible - and prevent - are necessarily inflected by the generic tropes and traits of the platform in question. This, then, is a rearticulation of my broader argument about <<define "informativity," "information and selfhood">> or of performance and selfhood on digital platforms.</p>

<p>A good point of entry for considering masculinity in Achewood is the 2006 arc ‚ÄúThe Great Outdoor Fight,‚Äù which was the first story arc published in hardcover, by Dark Horse Press in 2008. <i>The Great Outdoor Fight</i> tracks Ray and Roast Beef as they compete in - and ultimately win - the eponymous fight.</p>
<p>The Fight is an excellent case study for the performance of masculinity because it is a "homosocial enactment" in exactly the way Michael Kimmel writes about:</p>
<blockquote>
	We test ourselves, perform heroic feats, take enormous risks, all because we want other men to grant us our manhood. Masculinity as a homosocial enactment is fraught with danger, with the risk of failure, and with intense relentless competition. <<cite "33" "Kimmel, Michael. The Gender of Desire.">>
</blockquote>
<p>For Kimmel, men become men when they are recognized as such by other men, and the structure and ritual of competition is a pretext for precisely this mode of enactment.</p>

<blockquote>
	Three days! Three acres! Three THOUSAND men! Only one will win THE GREAT OUTDOOR FIGHT!

<p>Ray‚Äôs relationship with his father - and his attempt to validate his own masculinity by following in his father‚Äôs footsteps - follows generically stable story beats.

<p>More subversively, Ray and Beef ultimately violate the rules of the contest (and traditional masculinity) to win it on their own terms. This rejection of consensus codes that determine who is ‚Äòmanliest‚Äô is typical of Achewood as a strip, which spends much more time on traditional domestic work like cooking than on fighting, and generally deflates any legitimately ‚Äòmanly‚Äô display by its characters. Within the strip, Ray‚Äôs version of masculinity is performed through its inflection of a generically typical storyline.

Cornelius: I omitted the yeast and made a fresh malloreddus pasta, which I rolled out using my flask. Ray: Malloreddus? Cornelius: It's an eggless Sardinian dough. My dear Iris Gambol learned to make it the summer we spent in Cagliari. '67? '68? It escapes me. [THEN.] Beef: Alright not only did Cornelius buck the rules but he made a recipe that his dead first wife taught him before we were born Ray: That is /hard/. Cornelius, hands down."></a>

<p>Here, again, what makes the winner "manly" isn't his ability to fight; it's his ability to perform a domestic task. Cornelius wins because he "made a recipe that his dead first wife taught him."</p>
<p>Even still, there are other texts - and even other webcomics - that showcase men cooking, being clever, and winning through friendship. What makes <i>Achewood</i> -- and Ray specifically -- different is that that same version of masculinity is then refracted, fragmented, consistently, in other mediums.</p>

:: Achewood 9 [aw nobr]
<p><i>Ray‚Äôs Place</i>, the long-running advice column ‚Äúwritten by‚Äù Ray, is similarly grounded in gendered, medium-driven tropes that are ultimately undermined.<p>
<a href="assets/pdfs/rays_place.pdf"><img style="max-width:75%" src="assets/imgs/achewood_rays_place_header.png"></a>
<p>Ray explicitly posits ‚ÄúRay‚Äôs Place‚Äù as a ‚Äú<i>Playboy‚Äù</i>-type advice column:</p>
<blockquote>At first I thought I would kind of have this ‚ÄúPlayboy‚Äù type column‚Äîyou know, real gentlemen‚Äôs stuff, but with kind of a sense of hipness and adventure. Good clothes, good food,
high-end electronics and digital cigar cutters, maybe a little bit of etiquette and tips on personal grooming.</blockquote>
<p>From the very first entry, however, Ray‚Äôs performance of masculinity undermines itself:</p>
<blockquote>What does a real gentleman talk about, anyway? I guess a real gentleman doesn‚Äôt do the talking, but rather guides conversation in a clever yet undetectable way. Man, I ain‚Äôt no good at that.</blockquote>
<p>Ray tries to emulate the <i>Playboy</i> voice in response to a reader's question about a decidedly unhip topic - "the right way to eat Mexican food":</p>
<blockquote>GENTLE READER: few things in life are so uncomfortable as the enormous ‚Äúwind bubbles‚Äù one‚Äôs body creates after eating some delicious, tempting Mexican food. And just what is it about Mexican food that creates such a troublesome atmosphere within us? The answer: it is a complex system of enzymatic  chemical reactions which occur when soft, starchy foods meet the digestive acids which naturally pool in our stomachs.</blockquote>
<p>...but stops after about a paragraph, rejecting the inauthentic performance of traditional masculinity personified here by the voice of the anonymous Playboy writer:</p>
<blockquote>I feel so phony ‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt I just try to write in my normal style?<<cite "3" "Onstad, Chris. The Collected Ray's Place">></blockquote>

<p>That this misstepping moment occurs during an attempt to emulate the style of a so-called "men's <<define "magazine">>" is telling. As other scholars have remarked, the magazine is an active site for the inscription, reification, and enforcement of gender norms. As Amy N. Vreeland writes of the girl's magazine <i>Seventeen</i>:
<blockquote><i>Seventeen</i> and similar publications provide cultural "scripts" that fuel, shape, and maintain normative conceptions of appropriate teenage "femininity" in order to guide the creation of gender identity along dominant ideals. Hence, <i>Seventeen</i> can be considered a "gender manual."<<cite "v" "Vreeland, Amy N. Seventeen Magazine as a Manual for 'Doing Gender'">></blockquote>
<p>Ray here tries, and fails, to write a gender manual via the generic trappings he attempted to emulate, citing a sense of inauthenticity - echoing his rejection of the cultural script of the Great Outdoor Fight and of manliness more generally.</p>
<p>Even still, the advice column, like the magazine, functions like the conduct manual, which Berlant describes as a ‚Äúpragmatic pedagogic <<define "genre">>, an opportunity for retraining a reader into something different and yet more herself‚Äù <<cite "12" "Berlant, Lauren. The Female Complaint.">> <i>Ray‚Äôs Place</i> has a triple function, then: it establishes the broad outlines of ‚Äúmale‚Äù as genre within the constraints of the medium (and genre) of ‚Äúadvice column‚Äù; it situates Ray, as a fictional character, within that genre; and, thirdly, it allows Ray (and Onstad) to critique and deconstruct that genre - and its model of masculinity. </p>

<p>This emulation and disavowal demonstrates how the slippage between genre and gender performativity gets even slipperier when translated textually, particularly in the first-person style. Despite the deconstructive bent of the text, many of the questions Ray answers early on in the column is standard ‚Äúhow to be a gentleman‚Äù <i>Playboy</i>-style material - first date etiquette, the right watch to buy, proper cocktail selections, and so forth.</p>
<p>Onstad's pastiche was successful enough, in fact, that <i>GQ</i> asked Onstad to produce a ‚ÄúModern Gentleman‚Äôs Decision Making Flowchart,‚Äù which they published in their August 2008 issue.</p>
<a href="https://achewood.com/2008/09/10/title.html"><img style="max-width:100%" src="assets/imgs/achewood_flowchart.png"></a>
<p><i>Gentlemen's Quarterly</i>, like <i>Playboy</i>, is a men's <<define "magazine">> that presents a model of masculinity and sells the reader everything they need to make that masculinity real, provided they have the necessary money. But Onstad's contribution to <i>GQ</i> is typically playful, irreverent, and deconstructive.</p>
<p>First of all, the flow-chart itself is an atypical contribution to a magazine best known for its annual "Man of the Year" feature.</p>
<p>More specifically, take the three scenarios that the flowchart lays out: "a potential sexual encounter", "a one hundred and twelve dollar trip to Whole Foods so I can cook a two-course dinner for my girlfriend", and "a round of golf with a new client". Each scenario is fairly typical fodder for an advice column and for a men's magazine more generally - and each is deconstructed in a typically Onstadian fashion. The round of golf is successful after Ray cracks an inappropriate joke about letting "some scientists chop off [his] dick"; the fancy dinner is replaced by "DUDEMEAL, a special meal for dudes at eleven PM", and the sexual encounter is mostly in Ray's own mind, spurred by nothing more than a "chick... absently toying with her necklace so hard."</p>
<p>In all three ostensibly masculine scenarios, Ray fails to perform as a good <i>GQ</i> reader ought to perform - yet each scenario ends in something like success.</p>

<p>Ray‚Äôs personal blog is an even more personal glimpse into the voice and personality of this fictional character. These blogs are a substantial piece of Achewood: in fact, the final comic strip of Achewood's main run, before its recent revival as a popular Patreon, directs the reader to Onstad‚Äôs final blog post, where he writes:</p>
<blockquote>the blogs are where I personally think the heart and soul of that universe live [...] in words I haven‚Äôt had to maddeningly jockey into tiny speech bubbles‚Äù <<cite "*" "Onstad, Chris. 'Some News to Wrap Up 2016'.">>.</blockquote>
<p>Onstad provocatively figures the material and generic conventions of the comic strip as <<define "procrustean">>, and the blog as a more open medium.</p>
<p>Unlike the webcomic, with its generic punchlines and action sequences, and the advice column, with its performative and prescriptive enaction of masculinity, the personal blog is positioned as unvarnished and verbose; Ray‚Äôs blog alone stretches to over 250 pages. This genre is characterized by its confessional character, and thus lends itself a kind of introspection designed to puncture norms; rather than an outward-facing persona, on one's blog one can speak from "the heart and soul".</p>
<p>In an early entry, for example, Ray describes how much he enjoys <i>Sex in the City</i> and wishes he could ‚Äúhang with ladies like that [...] some ladies who tell it like it is and like to throw one back.‚Äù He explains his acquisition of the <i>Sex in the City</i> DVDs, however, as a mistake: he meant to order pornography. Even in the context of a personal blog aimed at his ‚Äúchochachos‚Äù (a made up word Ray uses to describe his readers), Ray explains away his introduction to feminine culture by reasserting his masculinity. He‚Äôs pulled simultaneously towards the ‚Äòfeminized‚Äô confessional genre of the online diary, which he engages elsewhere in the blogs, and being "maddeningly jockied" into the genre of masculinity.</p>
<p>By reading his performance on the blogs alongside his other mediated selves, however, we can see how flimsy that masculinity is. Even as one of the arbiters of maleness within (and, for the superfans who can come up with an Achewood quote for every situation, without) the world of Achewood - writing advice columns for <i>GQ</i>, winning the Great Outdoor Fight - Ray‚Äôs membership in manliness as a genre is constantly in question and must constantly be reasserted.</p>

<p>In 2023, after a long period of silence, Onstad announced his return to web publishing with the release of <a href="https://raybot.help/">RayBot</a>, a <<define "LLM">>-powered bot trained on the combined corpus of <i>Achewood</i>, along with content written specifically to turn Raybot into an accurate mimic of Ray's inimitable voice.</p>
<img src="assets/imgs/achewood_raybot.png" style="max-width:50%;">
<p>This bot is the result of a kind of <<define "technonecromancy">>, rebooting a defunct fictional character from the dead by feeding everything he was into a model and asking it to <<"spit out new words" "Text Generation">>spit out new words. And, somewhat shockingly, it worked pretty well; the bot got positive press coverage, which contributed to the successful launch of Onstad's Patreon, and fans generally responded well, sharing the best, most Raylike responses in a Discord server.</p>
<p>Raybot was successful because Ray has a well-defined voice that his readers can recognize, and because the genre of the advice column mitigates some of the shortfalls of the chatbot as a medium. In technocratic jargon, an advice column is "low hanging fruit"; a single query with a single response doesn't rely on a good long-term memory or coherence over the course of a conversation - two challenges with contemporary large language models. Additionally, the use case here lacks some of the <<define "risk" "AI risk">> that characterizes many of the higher-profile uses of large language models; nobody's insurance claim is being denied because of what Raybot says.</p>

<p>To conclude, Ray's multimedia masculinity is exemplary but not unique; one could look to Roast Beef‚Äôs alt zines or Nice Pete‚Äôs violently misogynistic novellas for other figurations of manliness refracted through and constrained by generic conventions.</p>
<p>In Achewood and in contemporary online culture, social gestures refract through the mediums on which they are performed, become legible only in their <<define "genre" "generic">> contexts, and situate their performer within this complex matrix. <<define "multimedial" "Multimediated">> masculinity differs primarily in its triangulating function - individual performances across a broad band of media simultaneously provide the illusion of internal consistency (the ‚Äòvoice‚Äô remains the same) and showcase how flexible, generically, any individual‚Äôs performance is.</p>
<p>It also highlights the porousness of the boundary between mediated fictional characters and mediated ‚Äòreal‚Äô persons; if our own personal production of ‚Äòcontent‚Äô through the various platforms on which we increasingly live our lives is self-consciously chosen, written in a way to conform with the twin generic demands of our media and our genders, then the gendered subject is always, to a greater or lesser degree, a fictional one.</p>
<p>I do not mean to reinscribe face-to-face interaction as an escape from this generic double-bind; in-person social behavior, too, is governed by generic codes of acceptability and legibility. What multimedia masculinity offers is a way of illuminating these codes by deconstructing the boundary between the self-consciously constructed fictionality of, say, a cartoon cat, written into being on a variety of platforms, that selfsame cartoon cat's digital shadow as projected by an AI model onto the contemporary internet, and the analogous fictionality and multimodality of the narrative human subject in the information age.</p>

<p>August Wilson‚Äôs 1982 play <i>Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom</i> opens in a recording studio, on two white men - Irvin, Ma Rainey‚Äôs agent, and Sturdyvant, the owner of the studio and the record label - testing their technology in advance of a session with Rainey and her band. Irvin hooks up a microphone while Sturdyvant watches from above, ensconced in what the script calls the ‚Äúcontrol booth"<<cite "x" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">> that is, in most productions, located physically above the main stage, like a prison guard's tower. This distance spatializes Wilson's description of Sturdyvant as a man who is "preoccupied with money... insensitive to black performers and prefers to deal with them at arm's length" <<cite "17" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">></p>

<p>Sturdyvant expects trouble from Rainey: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what she calls herself,‚Äù he hollers at Irvin, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not putting up with it. I just want to get her in here ‚Ä¶ record those songs on that list ‚Ä¶ and get her out. Just like <<define "clockwork">>, huh?‚Äù <<cite "18" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">>. When Rainey ultimately arrives, however - after the white men, her band, and the play‚Äôs audience has been waiting for about an hour  - she‚Äôs anything but clockwork. Whereas Sturdyvant wants a singing automaton he can record and sell, Rainey is defiantly and powerfully a human body from the moment she fills the stage.</p>
<p>	Wilson plays with this technologic/organic binary throughout the play: a technological whiteness, represented primarily by Sturdyvant, obsessed with clock-time and allied with the recording process, against a stubbornly embodied blackness, represented primarily although not exclusively by Rainey, who Wilson identifies with live performance and with the ‚Äòreal‚Äô blues.</p>
<p>The play stages a power struggle between these two poles, with Rainey insisting on her own bodiliness in the face of Sturdyvant and Irvin‚Äôs attempt to transmute her voice into a valuable commodity. Although this binary makes for compelling drama and speaks to the history of (largely white) exploitation of black musicians, it fails to capture the degree to which the historical Rainey took ownership of the recording technology that made her a household name - and threatens to renaturalize a rhetoric that equates blackness with an atavistic, primitive ‚Äòsoulfulness.‚Äô This section will begin, then, by sketching out how Wilson stages this binary, before problematizing it with reference to the historical Rainey‚Äôs own stage show and to Wilson‚Äôs own words outside of the playtext.</p>

<p>Through most of the play Sturdyvant is in a control-box, physically alienated from the recording session, and his commands come through a speaker in the recording studio. In contrast to Rainey, for whom lived experience is paramount, Sturdyvant‚Äôs speech suggests a subjectivity obsessed with <<define "clock-time" "clockwork">>. As I noted earlier, he wants the session to go ‚Äúlike clockwork;‚Äù when Rainey is late, he asks Irvin ‚ÄúDo you know what time it is? Have you looked at the clock?‚Äù <<cite "47" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">>, and when Rainey wants to stop the session for her coca-cola, he tells her ‚ÄúWait just a minute, Ma ‚Ä¶ you come in an hour late ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre way behind schedule as it is.‚Äù Indeed, it‚Äôs easy to read Slow Drag‚Äôs declaration that ‚Äúthe white man don‚Äôt know how to have a good time" <<cite "41" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">> as an indictment of Sturdyvant‚Äôs technologized obsession with the clock. Sturdyvant himself, then, can be read as the clockwork man that he wants to make Rainey into, having thoroughly internalized a mechanized, penny-pinching, second-counting mode of living.</p>

<p>Conversely, Ma Rainey‚Äôs recalcitrance throughout the recording session refers repeatedly back to her body. We‚Äôre told early in the play that she complained during a previous session of her sore throat. This time around, she starts by lambasting Sturdyvent for keeping the studio too cold:</p>
<blockquote>MA RAINEY: Why you all keep it so cold in here? Sturdyvant try and pinch every penny he can. You all wanna make some records, you better put some heat on in here or give me back my coat‚Äù <<cite "53" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">>.</blockquote>
<p>And although her throat‚Äôs fine this time around, she stops the recording session when she realizes that she hasn‚Äôt been given a bottle of Coca-Cola. In each case, she exerts control over the recording session by insisting upon her status as an embodied human being, with bodily urges and preferences. Hence her stated preference for live performance over recordings; when Irvin protests against Ma Rainey having her stuttering nephew Sylvester perform the spoken introduction to her song, she replies to his "Ma, we don't have time" with:</p>
<blockquote>If you wanna make a record, you gotta find time. I aint' playing with you, Irvin. I can walk out of here and go back to my tour. I got plenty fans. I don't need to go through all of this. Just go and get the boy a microphone <<cite "74" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom">>.</blockquote> 
<p>Here Rainey directly mobilizes her body - threatening to <i>walk</i> out to her embodied tour - to take control over the microphone as a tool of the recording process.</p>
<p>What Irvin and Sturdyvant's <<define "apparatus">> aims to capture, though, is some version of Ma Rainey that is outside of and separate from her body, a disembodied voice that the technological apparatus means to capture - as Rainey says, all they want is to take her "voice and trap it in them fancy boxes with all them buttons and dials" <<cite "78" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom">>. Rainey's attitude towards the technology of recording is dismissive and uninterested; she reduces the operations of the recording apparatus to gnomic "buttons and dials" while dialing in on the far more important, coercive power dynamics at play. Rainey's voice comes from her body, and her blues come from her body, and she uses that body and that voice to exert power over the recording process.</p>

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Ma Rainey 5">><</silently>>

:: Ma Rainey 5 [mrbb nobr]
<p>Rainey's power is contested and contained by the technological exploitation of Sturdyvant and his ilk; where Rainey, standing barefoot in the studio, has control, the black members of her backing band do not. Consider Levee who thinks himself a keen observer of the power dynamics of the recording studio. When he insists that the band practice and perform <i>his</i> version of "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom", he does so by aligning himself with Sturdyvant and Irvin's recording technology:</p>
<blockquote>Ma's the boss on the road! We at a recording session. Mr. Sturdyvant and Mr. Irvin say what's gonna be here! <<cite "37" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">></blockquote>
<p>And unlike Rainey, Levee prefers the technological embrace of the studio over live performance; he dismisses the tour as "tent-show nonsense" <<cite "65" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">></p>
<p>But Levee's understanding of his relationship with the power of recording technology is fundamentally flawed. We never see "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" recorded in the play; although Sylvester successfully performs the spoken intro and Rainey sings the song (her way), Levee accidentally kicks (with his fancy new shoes!) the microphone plug out and the take is lost. This failure prefigures Levee's unsuccessful attempts later in the play to exert power over Sturdyvant, who buys off his songs for five dollars and leaves him powerless. Levee's immediate response to this loss of power is a violent explosion at Toledo, who scuffs Levee's shoe accidentally. Where Rainey uses her body and her voice to control the recording session, Levee's body gets in the way, with fatal consequences.</p>

<p>Rainey's references to her body makes sense because the blues she sings are inextricable from her corporeal self.  The first song that the audience sees her sing is a verse of "Those Dogs of Mine,‚Äù a song about her aching feet, after removing her shoes and rubbing her soles.</p>

<blockquote>

Oh, how my corns did burn<br>
I had to keep on the shady side of the street<br>
To keep out the light of the sun<br>
<br>
Oh, Lord, these dogs of mine<br>
They sure do worry me all the time<br>
The reason why, I don't know<br>
Sometimes I soak 'em in Sapolio <<cite "249" "Davis, Angela. Blues Legacies and Black Feminism.">>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Levee, who needs his shoes to successfully perform his masculinity, Rainey records her music barefoot.</p>
<p>Similarly, the title song, ‚ÄúMa Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom,‚Äù refers to a dance, but is also a reference to Rainey‚Äôs own (sexual) body:</p>
<blockquote> Want to see the dance you call the black bottom<br>
I wanna learn that dance<br>
Want to see the dance you call your big black bottom<br>
That puts you in a trance<br>
<br>
All the boys in the neighborhood<br>
They say your black bottom is really good<br>
Come on and show me your black bottom<br>
I wanna learn that dance <<cite "231" "232" "Davis, Angela. Blues Legacies and Black Feminism.">>
</blockquote>
<p>This focus on the body is not atypical for the blues; unlike most other popular music of their era, the blues deviated in their "provocative and pervasive sexual -- including homosexual -- imagery" <<cite "3" "Davis, Angela. Blues Legacies and Black Feminism.">>. While not all of Rainey's music is focused on her body, Wilson's selection of songs that identify her music with her corporeal self highlights the difference between her and Sturdyvant, and sets up an oppositional relationship between her black body and the white technology of the recording studio. As Alan Nadel writes, Rainey‚Äôs ‚Äúsinging isn‚Äôt something already formed but something formed in the act‚Äù <<cite "16" "Nadel, Alan. May All Your Fences Have Gates.">> - or in Rainey‚Äôs own words, that the blues are ‚Äúlife‚Äôs way of talking [...] you sing ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs a way of understanding life‚Äù <<cite "86" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">>.</p>

<p>	According to this reading, then, Ma Rainey represents the blues - and blackness - as lived, embodied experience against a technologized whiteness that severs Ma Rainey‚Äôs music from its context, creating the disjunction of information from its temporo-spatial context that is endemic of <<define "transcoding">> more broadly and that echoes the historical violence perpetrated against African-Americans throughout the history of America.</p>
<p>This contrast is most vivid in Rainey‚Äôs figuration of the recording process as one of sexual violation:</p>
<blockquote>They don't care nothing about me. All they want is my voice. Well, I done learned that, and they gonna treat me like I want to be treated no matter how much it hurt them... As soon as they get my voice down on them recording machines, then it‚Äôs just like if I‚Äôd be some whore and they roll over and put their pants on. <<cite "79" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.">></blockquote> 
<p>Rainey‚Äôs simile recalls a history of white sexual violence against and exploitation of black female bodies, invoked elsewhere in the play through Levee‚Äôs story about his mother‚Äôs rape, but it also symbolically links her music with her sexualized body. Rainey has power in the recording studio because of her voice, and because she doesn't <i>need</i> to record her music to succeed. Again, she prefers live performance, telling Irvin that he can either record her music her way or she can "carry [her] black bottom on back down South to my tour, 'cause [she] don't like it up here no ways" <<cite "63" "Wilson, August. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom">>.</p>

<p>Wilson's play sketches out this opposition cleanly and consistently, but the particularity of the technologies in question, along with an examination of the historical Rainey's own live concerts, demonstrates how Rainey herself deconstructed this binary in her larger-than-life performance.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs first think about the particularity of the vinyl record as the medium onto which Rainey is being recorded, and through which Rainey will be disseminated. One trend we see as recording technology progresses is a moving window of <<define "nostalgia" "Nostalgia">>. The earliest example of this may be the discussion of writing in Plato‚Äôs <i>Phaedrus</i>, which Socrates worries will:</p>
<blockquote> ...introduce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practice using their memory because they will put their trust in writing, which is external and depends on signs that belong to others, instead of trying to remember from the inside.<<cite "*" "Plato. Phaedrus.">></blockquote>
<p>Lived experience, by this account, has an <span class="glow">aura</span> that dissipates when committed to paper via writing - we might think, here, of the rest of the band‚Äôs accusing Toledo‚Äôs of literacy getting him to the point where he has forgotten ‚Äúhow to laugh and have a good time.

<p>In the contemporary moment, however, vinyl records and other analog technology has itself acquired a (not unproblematic) nostalgic premium; see, for example, the discussion - by two white kids - of blues records in Hari Kunzru‚Äôs <i>White Tears</i> - the digital is ‚Äúout of touch with the human body‚Äù and lacks ‚Äúthe soul, the vibration of an animal-gut string, the resonance of lacquered rosewood‚Äù. In contrast with <<define "noiseless" "noise">>, <<define "lossless" "loss">> digital technology, the analog record, with its snaps, pops, and scratches, attests to its own historicity as an object that has travelled through time and demands a social relation between its recorder and its auditor.</p>

	AUGUST WILSON: [...] I used to collect 78 records that I would buy from the St Vincent de Paul store, at five cents apiece, and I did this indiscriminately [....] And one day in my sack of records there was a yellow-labeled record that had a typewritten label, which was kind of odd. And I put it on, and it was ‚ÄùNobody in Town Can Bake a Sweet Jelly Roll Like Mine.‚Äù It was by Bessie Smith, of course, and I listened to it, and I had one of those old 78s where you had to keep putting the needle in, and I recall I listened to the record 22 straight times. I had never in my life  -- [...] And just over and, you know. I had never heard anything like it ‚Äî and I was literally stunned by its beauty. [...] And it spoke ‚Äì there was an immediate emotional response.<br>
	BILL MOYERS: What did it say?<br>
	AUGUST WILSON: Well, it was someone speaking directly to me.<<cite "*" "Moyers, Bill, and August Wilson.">>
</blockquote>

<p>Wilson‚Äôs description is intensely physical: he begins by describing the material conditions surrounding his finding Bessie Smith‚Äôs record, describes the ‚Äúodd‚Äù label,‚Äù and talks about the experience of having to put the needle down on the record twenty-two straight times. His response, too, is both physical and emotional - he‚Äôs ‚Äúliterally stunned‚Äù by its beauty; the record ‚Äúspeaks directly to him,‚Äù and he has an ‚Äúimmediate emotional response.‚Äù The technological apparatus makes possible the very kind embodied experience that, in the play, it opposes.</p>

<p>In the same interview, Wilson talks about the blues as an information communication technology itself, as a ‚Äúphilosophical system at work,‚Äù a ‚Äúway of passing along information,‚Äù where the music provides an emotional context not unlike the <span class="glow"><<define "Benjaminian aura" "Benjamin's aura">></span> for the information that the song contains. Rather than reifying the opposition between white technology and black embodiedness, as I‚Äôve argued that <i>Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom</i> threatens to do, Wilson here instead argues that the blues functioned as its own of discourse network whose message was that ‚Äúthere [is] a nobility to the lives of blacks in America.‚Äù<<cite "*" "Moyers, Bill, and August Wilson.">></p>
<p>And those recordings make it possible for us, too, to listen to the voice of Gertrude Rainey, who died at the age of 53 in 1939. Like photography, phonography is an elegiac art; to paraphrase Susan Sontag, all phonographs are <i>memento mori</i>, and testify to time's relentless melt. <<cite "15" "Sontag, Susan. On Photography.">> Writing specifically about the recorded voice, Friedrich Kittler notes that all phonographic recordings are always already posthumous, and that when a record is played it is always "a corpse that speaks" <<cite "83" "Kittler, Friedrich. Gramophone, Film, Typewriter.">>. The record is <<define "nostalgic" "Nostalgia">> by nature, but the undead voice can speak with startling vitality.</p>

:: Ma Rainey 11 [mrbb nobr]
<p>In ‚ÄúStaging the Blues,‚Äù Paige McGinley recounts a secondhand description of one of the historical Ma Rainey's live performances:</p>
<blockquote>Collectively, the audience began to call out, "The Phantuuhm." [...] The call referred to Rainey herself. Her presence was duly conjured by the Wildcats Jazz Band's instrumental blues and the audience's enthused chant: "The Phaaaaantuhm! The Phaaaaaantuhm!" The curtain rose, revealing a giant prop replica of a Victrola; a chorus dancer began to play a similarly outsized prop record on the phonograph. From inside the Victrola, not yet visible to spectators, Rainey began to sing her wildly popular ‚ÄúMoonshine Blues,‚Äù [...] At a climactic moment in the song, she emerged from the boxy set piece, glittering in a famously extravagant gown and jewels, to the great delight of her audience.<<cite "31" "McGinley, Paige. Staging the Blues.">></blockquote>
<p>Whereas Wilson‚Äôs Rainey sets up an opposition between her records and her touring - privileging the latter - the real Rainey brought the record onto the stage. The historical Gertrude "Ma" Rainey refused to identify the technological with whiteness and instead claimed it as a part of her own show. Rainey‚Äôs success as a recording artist meant that much of her audience would already have heard her voice in their own homes; her stage performance suggests that she embraced the reach and the popularity that the then-novel technology gave her, collapsing the distance Wilson imagines between the embodied and the technological. This does not, of course, undo the fundamentally exploitative relationship that existed between Rainey and her white producers at Paramount ‚ÄúRace‚Äù Records, any more than Rainey‚Äôs choice of a painted cotton field as a backdrop for her live shows undoes the violence of slavery. It does, however, demonstrate how Rainey, as a savvy stage performer in her own right, made use of the very technology that Sturdyvent hopes will make her superfluous.</p>
<p>And the call that "conjured" her, for "the Phantuhm", suggests a similar savviness to the way that the phonograph can only ever record a ghost, and that the voice that Sturdyvant and his machine captures is, at best, an echo.</p>

<p>By reading Wilson‚Äôs play alongside his--and Rainey‚Äôs--own history, then, we can see that the conflict isn‚Äôt necessarily between a technology which is essentially white and a body that is essentially black; instead, the problem in <i>Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom</i> is historically contingent. Sturdyvent controls the recording apparatus, and Sturdyvent is exploitative, but the product-the record-is ultimately Rainey‚Äôs, available for a young Wilson to pick out of a bin and draw inspiration from years later. Rainey‚Äôs stage performance suggests how black music has functioned, in Louis Chude-Sokei‚Äôs words, as ‚Äúthe primary space of direct black interaction with technology and informatics‚Äù <<cite "5" "Chude-Sokei, Louis. The Sound of Culture.">>, and that the utilization of that technology makes possible the sort of emotional encounter, disjointed in time and space, whose absence Benjamin mourns and that Wilson, in the aforementioned interview, credits as so instrumental to his development as a playwright.</p>

<p><<define "Loss">>, which Lev Manovich identified as a major feature of so-called 'new media' almost 20 years ago, informs the game‚Äôs interface design. Although the game does have <<define "non-diegetic">> music and the clips have <<define "diegetic">> audio, the main aural input is ambient; the fluorescent lights visible in reflection on the simulated CRT screen of the game buzz and sputter, typing in search queries clatters like a mechanical keyboard, and the fans and hard disks of the decrepit, simulated computer audibly hum.  Thus the audio cues create three separate levels of reality: the world of the video clips, the world of the person accessing the video clips, in the fluorescent-lit room, and the world of the player.</p>
<p>Indeed, in an <a target="_blank" href="assets/pdfs/app_unwrapper_interview.pdf">interview</a>, Barlow noted exactly that separation as the purpose of the non-diegetic music:</p>
<blockquote>The music was one of those things that was there to cut through the experience and create a little bit of separation between the ‚Äòworld of the game‚Äô and the world of the player ‚Äì important in establishing that there‚Äôs a difference.</blockquote>

<p><i>Her Story's</i> interface more generally situates itself as an obsolete police database, called LOGIC, that‚Äôs been made accessible to the player character as a result of a Freedom of Information request. Time has not been kind to the database. The videos themselves have been artificially aged to look like old VHS tapes, providing another layer of loss and <<define "noise">> beyond the CRT. Additionally, the order of the clips has disappeared (although timestamps appear in each video, making reassembly possible), and (most importantly) the transcript of the interviews through which the player trawls is itself inaccessible, visible only in closed-caption snippets on each clip (a brief note, signed by "SB," ‚Äì short for Sam Barlow? - says that the detective‚Äôs other tapes were lost in a flood in 1997).</p>

<p>Those fluorescent lights outline the starkest instance of this operative absence, which became clear for me, at least, only upon my discovery of the "anti-glare filter" buried in LOGIC‚Äôs settings. Once the player activates the anti-glare filter, the fluorescent lights disappear; it is only after having done so that it becomes obvious that they were there the whole time, and ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì that they were broken up by the ghostly silhouette of the player character ‚Äì a silhouette that matches the player themselves. Thus the player's <<define "avatar" "Avatar">> becomes visible when rendered invisible by the anti-glare feature.</p>

<p>If the user never discovers the anti-glare feature, then they become aware of their avatar's reflection at specific moments of discovery within the game. Occasional light effects in the play-world of Susan make her reflection more visible. Although the precise logic governing these light effects is difficult to pinpoint, numerous players have reported that it occurs when a particular pivotal discovery is made: for example, that Viva Siefert is playing not one but two women, or that these two women are identical twins.</p>

<p>This moment of recognition works alongside the piece‚Äôs general concern with mirrors and reflections. The central mystery involves a doppelganger, the murder victim worked at a glazier‚Äôs and made <<define "mirrors" "mirror">> for a living, the interviewee's names are both palindromic (Hannah and Eve), and the murder weapon is ultimately a shard of a mirror. The player sees Susan's face as a reflection of their own, positioned on the screen in such a way that her face mirrors the player's own; one needn't (and probably shouldn't) jump to Lacan to explore how this creates a robust <<define "apparatus">> for identification.</p>

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Her Story 7">><</silently>>

:: Her Story 7 [hs nobr]
<p>The moment of recognition is emphasized by the nested structure of the game, where the player is encouraged by the interface to identify first with the detective interrogating the woman, then with the person in front of the database ‚Äì Sarah ‚Äì and in a few particularly clever moments, where the results of a search query seem to address a prurient gamer rather than the detective, with themselves as a player.</p>

<p>The player receives a similar admonition when they search for the keyword "twin", though that one is more misleading than sincere; the "twin" hypothesis seems the most plausible, according to my reading, in a way that sidesteps some familiar problems with multiple personality disorders in narrative.</p>

<p>These moments recall some of the best parts of other games, where the player is abruptly thrown from the distant position of player-controlling-an-avatar into a character within the game world; for example, in the horror-cum-dating-sim <i><<define "Doki Doki Literature Club">></i>, when the antagonist Monika shifts from addressing the user as the name they provided at the start of the game and, by digging through files on the player's computer, refers to them instead by their real name. Interface establishes relationships between subjects and objects, and games are uniquely suited to have moments that operate transdiegetically, that grab the player by their shirt and pull them through the screen.</p>

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Her Story 8">><</silently>>

:: Her Story 8 [hs nobr] 
<p>The game's absent transcript pushes that transdiegetic identification in part because it is in many players‚Äô experience (including my own) supplemented by another player-generated one: a notepad where the player starts to outline the murder at the center of the game. Because the game has no set path, the player has to investigate, and investigation here means keeping track of names, places, and important objects. I ended up with a four-page web of connections, with notes on each node. Adam Smith, of Rock Paper Shotgun, cited a similar experience in his review:</p>
<blockquote>I have three pages of notes, tracking events, cross-referencing details, picking out contradictions. It‚Äôs a dissection of life based on assumptions that seem inevitable and insights that are mine and mine alone.<<cite "*" "Smith, Adam. Wot I Think: Her Story.">></blockquote>
<p>The notebook, here, functions alongside the game itself as a <<define "cognitive prosthesis" "prosthetic">> to create a system of texts and player which both extends the game interface out into the world and interpolates the player into the gameworld.</p>

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Her Story 9">><</silently>>

<p>This system can be provocatively described, I think, as what N. Katherine Hayles calls a <<define "cognitive assemblage">>:</p>
<blockquote>tighter or looser collections of technical objects and human participants through which cognitions circulate in the form of information, interpretations, and meanings.<<cite "10" "Hayles, N. Katherine. Writing Posthuman: The Literary Text as Cognitive Assemblage.">></blockquote> 
<p>The kinds of identification that an interface like that of <i>Her Story</i> ‚Äì with its punctum of pad of paper, along with its funhouse of nested reflections, making porous the boundary between self and screen ‚Äì gives rise to a different kind of "reading" subject that <<define "extends the mind" "extended mind">> across multiple platforms. The <<define "cognition">> imbricated in untangling <i>Her Story</i>'s mysteries takes place at multiple levels, on multiple platforms; for someone like Hayles, this creates a truly <<define "posthuman">> subject, a kind of <<define "cyborg">> that's less science fiction and more grounded in contemporary reality.</p>

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Her Story 10">><</silently>>

:: Her Story 10 [hs nobr]
<p>This subject, stretched between paper, screen, and keyboard, uniquely arises because of the game's <<define "multimedial">> and <<define "heterogeneric">> structure, which many of the game's contemporary reviewers commented on. The Washington Post's Michael Thomsen called <i>Her Story</i> a "beautiful amalgam of the cinema and video game formats [that] wouldn't work as a linear film" <<cite "*" "Thomsen, Micahel. 'Her Story' Review'">>, or that <i>Polygon</i>‚Äôs Colin Campbell proclaimed <i>Her Story</i> the best video game of 2015 by saying "I don‚Äôt think you will ‚Äòread‚Äô a better mystery novel this year" <<cite "*" "Kollar, Philip. Polygon's 2015 Games of the Year #1: Her Story">>.

<p>This last is a provocative statement. Other critics, particularly Emily Short, have effectively gestured towards Her Story‚Äôs mining of Gothic tropes. Short writes:</p>

<blockquote>it's a Gothic story, fundamentally, the bones of Radcliffe and Bronte still visible under the wrappings of more modern genres. The duality of persons, the midwife, the poison, the significant pictures that are usually kept covered up; the obsession with mirrors and fairy-tales, doppelgangers and disguises, the forbidden places within the home, the family secrets preserved by servants, the false parentage. <<cite "*" "Short, Emily. Her Story, Further Reflections">></blockquote>

<p>While I do not disagree with Short's assessment, I'd like to shift our focus to a <<define "genre">> which is a neighbor of the Gothic: detective fiction.</p>

<<silently>><<set _next_passage to "Her Story 11">><</silently>>

:: Her Story 11 [hs nobr]
<p>Charles Rzepka defines detective fiction as featuring four elements: a detective, a mystery, an investigation, and ‚Äì most usefully and intruigingly for those of us interested in interactive narrative ‚Äì what Rzepka calls the "puzzle element." Rzepka defines the "puzzle element" as:</p>

<blockquote>the presentation of the mystery as an ongoing problem for the reader to solve, and its powers to engage the reader‚Äôs own reasoning abilities.<<cite "10" "Rzepka, Charles. Detective Fiction.">></blockquote> 

<p>Those stories wherein the puzzle element directly engages the reader‚Äôs attention and powers of inference are, for him, "detective fiction," or "stories of detection" as distinguished from a mystery story, which may lack the puzzle element.</p>

<p>But the puzzle element in Her Story isn‚Äôt there to make the player identify with the actual detective; in fact, several moments in the game give the detective specific traits that alienate them from the player. We learn, for example, that the detective has red hair and children. The real ‚Äòdetective‚Äô in Her Story is Sarah, whose ghostly silhouette reflects the player's face, and her motive isn‚Äôt determining innocence or guilt; it‚Äôs figuring out who her mother is, and, in "SB"‚Äôs words at the ‚Äòend‚Äô of the game, to "understand why your mother did what she did."</p>

<p>It is possible, then, to identify (as Emily Short does, in her longer meditation on the game) with Eve and with Hannah. This identification is most interesting, however, through Sarah ‚Äì identifying with a character who is identifying with someone else. The lossy interface here thematizes this identification as well, with VHS distortion and a clunky search function operating as a proxy for the temporal distance that separates mother from daughter. This reading twists the title of the work, with <i>Her</i> growing to refer not to Hannah and Eve but instead to Sarah. These kinds of technologically ‚Äì and specifically videotape - mediated relationships between parent and child make up a familiar trope; consider, as a node for comparison, the relationship between Prairie and Frenesi Gates in Thomas Pynchon‚Äôs <i>Vineland</i>, between Hal and James Incandenza in David Foster Wallace‚Äôs <i>Infinite Jest</i>, or between Nell and Miranda in Neal Stephenson's <i>The Diamond Age</i>.</p>

<i>Her Story</i> is at turns alienating and interpolating, in a genre that was interactive long before it was electronic, and the kinds of identification it creates are complex, often shocking, and masterfully executed through its interface. In a contemporary moment where so many of our own social gestures are mediated technologically, dislocated radically in time and in space, the kinds of identification that Her Story‚Äôs interface makes possible are worth consideration.

<p><i>Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape</i> stands out among Samuel Beckett‚Äôs drama for its sentimentality. In a self-mocking statement from a 1958 letter to Donald McWhinnie at the BBC, Beckett described the play as ‚Äòrather a s[e]ntimental affair in my best original English manner‚Äô <<cite "115" "Beckett, Samuel. The Letters of Samuel Beckett, Volume III: 1957-1965">>. This sentimentality is primarily backwards-looking, obsessed as Krapp is with memory, and undercut by Krapp‚Äôs own cynicism throughout. Paradoxically, however, Krapp is the closest Beckett gets to science fiction, set on a late evening in the future and centred on a then-futuristic technology: the magnetic tape recorder. The play thus looks forward in order to look back, utilising then-novel <<define "medium">> technology to present and undermine a <<define "nostalgic" "Nostalgia">> vision of a brighter past.</p>

<p>This ‚Äòlooking back‚Äô looks like Krapp, surrounded by darkness, playing tapes recorded by the person he once was and failing to construct a stable self that bridges the years between the old man listening and the young fools recording. Krapp‚Äôs situation was atypical for his historical moment but is quotidian in the  <<define "information age" "Information Age">>. Lived experience is recorded with or without our consent by a variety of technological apparatuses. That mediated experience becomes inseparable from ourselves as the content and ads that various platforms feed us, the <<define "database" "Database">> through which we remember ourselves, and the <<define "social gestures" "information and selfhood">> by which we perform ourselves into being online. Krapp‚Äôs treatment of nostalgia alongside media technology is not incidental: the technologization of human experience often yields precisely the sentimental nostalgia that Krapp both engages in and problematizes.</p>

<p>Krapp‚Äôs relationships with the various cognitive <<define "apparatuses" "apparatus">> he surrounds himself with prefigures what subjectivity looks like in the information age. The subjectivity that arises out of the complex interactions between the listener and their <<define "prosthetic" "Prosthetic">> memory can be characterised as what Olga Beloborodova has called ‚Äòpostcognitivist‚Äô: a way of moving beyond the Cartesian framework to instead consider how Beckett‚Äôs fictional minds are more often than not ‚Äògrounded in the interaction with their fictional storyworlds‚Äô <<cite "1" "Beloborodova, Olga. Postcognitivist Beckett">>. Considering Krapp‚Äôs relationship with his tapes from a postcognitivist perspective suggests how the construction of an abiding subject in the information age simultaneously depends upon and is imperilled by the particular technologies that project the voice into the dark.</p>

<p>In 1975, Beckett told <<cycler "Pierre Chabert" "Pierre Chabert, who performed the role of Krapp in the Paris production of that year">>that Krapp should "become as much as possible one with the machine"<<cite "105" "Chabert, Pierre. ‚ÄòSamuel Beckett as Director‚Äô, in James Knowlson (ed.), Samuel Beckett: Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape Theatre Workbook">>. This direction turns Krapp into a kind of <<define "cyborg" "Cyborg">> - characterised, by Donna Haraway among others, in large part by the breakdown of the boundary between the biological and the mechanical and between the material and the immaterial <<cite "11" "12" "Haraway, Donna. ‚ÄòA Cyborg Manifesto‚Äô.">>. Crucially, these borders do not break down neatly in Krapp; instead, the mechanical is personified and the biological becomes mechanized. Krapp‚Äôs particular postmodern subjectivity is complicated by biological and technological contingency in a way that demands a more specific paradigm than the cyborg. As N. Katherine Hayle argues, the audiotape in Krapp functions "not only as a theme, a metaphor, or a vehicle for expression but as a mode of relation that produce[s] a certain kind of postmodern subjectivity" <<cite "75" "Hayles, N. Katherine. How We Became Posthuman.">> - one that goes beyond Haraway‚Äôs leaky boundaries into something that is simultaneously more radical and more ubiquitous in the information age.</p>

<p>One mode of thinking through this postcognitivist subjectivity that arises out of Krapp‚Äôs relationship with his technological prostheses comes from the field of cognitive science. In 'The Extended Mind' (1998), Andy Clark and David Chalmers address the boundary between the mind and the rest of the world and ultimately advocate for what they call "active externalism," a way of thinking about the mind that acknowledges the active role of the environment, including technological devices, in driving cognitive processes.<<cite '2' 'Clark, Andy and Chalmers, David. "The Extended Mind".'>>.</p>
<p>For Clark and Chalmers, a student doing long division by hand is not just using the pen and paper as a tool; some of the work of <<define "cognition">> is actively platformed on the page. Because the mind is the seat of cognition, it makes sense to think about that student‚Äôs mind as extending beyond his skin and onto the page. In cases like these:</p>
<blockquote>the human organism is linked with an external entity in a two-way interaction, creating a coupled system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right. All the components in the system play an active causal role, and they jointly govern behaviour in the same sort of way that cognition usually does. If we remove the external component the system's behavioural competence will drop, just as it would if we removed part of its brain. Our thesis is that this sort of coupled process counts equally well as a cognitive process, whether or not it is wholly in the head.<<cite '8' '9' 'Clark, Andy and Chalmers, David. "The Extended Mind".'>></blockquote>

<p>This condition is generalized in a contemporary technological moment characterized by ubiquitous smartphones through which an increasing amount of cognition and recollection takes place. Krapp can be thought of, from the perspective of the extended mind, not as a mind bounded by his skin acted on by his tapes, his dictionary, and his ledger, but instead as an enmeshed system of <<define "cognitive loops" "Cognitive Loops">> -- not unlike N. Katherine Hayles' <<define "cognitive assembalge">>.</p>

<p>His dependence on these linguistic, technological prostheses to live the life he does, and the degree to which the life the audience sees is focused on the creation of further tapes, denaturalises the body as the sole spatial and cognitive seat of the subject. Krapp‚Äôs ‚Äòmind‚Äô is distributed, in other words, and this distributed mind implies a self distributed both in space and in time.</p>

<p>Other critics have remarked on the applicability of the extended mind hypothesis, alongside other post-Cartesian, post-cognitivist frameworks, to Beckett‚Äôs work. Indeed, Dirk van Hulle‚Äôs paradigm for his genetic treatment of Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape is cognitive philosophy, and elsewhere he writes that Beckett</p>

<p>Relatedly, Olga Beloborodova and Pim Velhurst have written convincingly on how a postcognitivist angle highlights "the mind-world nexus" in which Beckett‚Äôs plays are grounded in order to call the "Cartesian inside-outside boundary" into question <<cite "240" "Beloborodova, Olga and Pim Velhurrst, ‚ÄòBroadcasting the Mind: Extended Cognition in Beckett‚Äôs Radio Plays‚Äô">>. Where Beloborodova and Velhurst have focused on Beckett‚Äôs radio plays, however, and van Hulle‚Äôs interest in genetic criticism lends itself most readily to Daniel Dennett‚Äôs "<<define "multiple drafts" "Multiple Drafts">>" model of consciousness, I will apply this postcognitivist framework to Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape primarily in reference to Clark and Chalmers‚Äô extended mind hypothesis as a way of considering how the proliferation of cognitive prostheses in the information age makes Krapp‚Äôs situation more general. Krapp, I argue, is a clear example of how <<define "cognition" "Cognition">> and <<define "memory" "Memory">> - and with them personal identity - can exist on multiple platforms, and how the cohesion of that identity depends on the precarious interface between those platforms.</p>

<p>Krapp exemplifies the centrality of interface in the production of this postcognitivist subjectivity; by slowing down the rate of information flow and embodying each element of the cognitive apparatus, the play productively stages the relationships that exist between ourselves and the platforms on which we store our memories and, in many ways, live our lives. This staging illuminates some of the potential problems that accompany this prostheticization of cognition.</p>
<p>Memory-as-information becomes the key term in this form of reckoning, replacing Haraway‚Äôs cyborg with what Luciano Floridi calls an "<<define "inforg" "Inforg">>": a way of thinking about subjects that highlights the "intrinsically informational nature of human agents" <<cite "36" "Floridi, Luciano.

<p>One-way information flow like Krapp‚Äôs use of the dictionary to look up the word "<<define "viduity" "Viduity">>" does not necessarily, for Clark and Chalmers, constitute extended cognition, although it is a sort of cognitive <span class="glitch" data-text="glitch"><<define "glitch" "Glitch">></span>. Instead, the interaction must be "two-way" in order to create a "coupled system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right."

<p>Most of what we see of Krapp‚Äôs life seems to be governed by his relationship with his tapes in this reciprocal way. To begin with, accessing his prosthetic memories requires information from his ledger and his dictionary. At 39, he spends his birthday "with closed eyes, separating the grain from the husks" and jotting down notes on the back of an envelope - that is, deciding what moments are "worth having when all the dust has settled" (2006, 217). On his last tape, he notes his revelry in the word "spool" as the "happiest moment of the past half million" (2006, 222).</p>

<p>The memories he ends up recording are about the process of choosing, recording, and accessing other memories through his tapes. His fixation with the past, mediated through his technological prostheses, governs his present actions to an increasing degree; in order to live within his past, he must spend his present keeping, locating, and playing his tapes. The way in which Krapp becomes inextricably enmeshed in these <<define "feedback loops" "Feedback Loop">> exemplifies the transition from history, where information communication technologies record and transmit data, to what Floridi calls <<define "hyperhistory" "Hyperhistory">>, where interactions with those same technologies become the object that is recorded, transmitted, and processed. Krapp‚Äôs life becomes a recording-in-progress, a collection of two-way feedback loops that enmesh his body into his technological devices and consign his bodily pleasures to a nostalgic past accessible only via audiotape.</p>

<p>For Chalmers and Clark, these two-way systems of organic and inorganic material must be reliably coupled with one another. This problem of ‚Äòreliable coupling‚Äô ‚Äì of access that is continually available, and of a relatively frictionless interface - gets at one of the central paradoxes of the life of the inforg, which in turn underlines why Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape functions so well as a <<define "thought experiment" "Thought Experiment">> about cognitive inforgs. We are most fully ‚Äòinforg‚Äô when the interface between our bodily selves and the technologies which co-constitute us is most transparent; when our phone‚Äôs batteries are fully charged, for example, we might be said to ‚Äòknow‚Äô our friends‚Äô cell phone numbers because the transparency of the interface means that the information is <<define "zuhanden" "Zuhanden">>, to borrow Heideggarian terminology, or ready-to-hand. On the other "hand," when that interface breaks down ‚Äì when the device instead becomes <<define "vorhanden" "Vorhanden">> - we become aware of our technological prostheses as contingent apparatuses that can be removed from us. In other words, we are most cybernetic when we are least aware of it.</p>

<p>However, Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape and Beckett‚Äôs focus more generally on the fragility of the human body calls to our attention the fact that this central paradox of the inforg is active inside the skull as well as out. Human memory, Krapp demonstrates, is not categorically more reliably accessible; the interface between what might be called the <<define "narrative self" "Narrative Self">> and access to memory is also fallible, and its failure comes with an awareness of the self as a hybrid organism of mind and body ‚Äì a body which is, in the reckoning of Hayles, "the original prosthesis we all learn to manipulate" (1999, 3).  Although Hayles‚Äô reference to "body" is typically taken to mean one‚Äôs hands, feet, eyes, and so on, the inforg Krapp illuminates how individual systems of the brain can come to seem prosthetic themselves. By oscillating both prosthetic and organic memory between zuhanden and vorhanden, Beckett demonstrates the disintegration of the narrative self and, critically, that the idea of an integrated pre-technological subject is just as much a nostalgic illusion as the myth of a utopian future whereby the posthuman subject is perfectly integrated with their prosthetic mind.</p>

<p>Krapp accesses his mechanized memories through an interface that is anything but seamless. The play spends a significant amount of time on the process Krapp undergoes in order to play a tape ‚Äì to move from "staring vacuously" to his "listening posture" (2006, 216). He retrieves his ledger and searches through the pages for the entry he wants. The stage directions specify his pawing past poorly-organised boxes ‚Äì four, two, nine, seven, and only then to the ‚Äòthree‚Äô that he‚Äôs looking for. Ejaculations like "the little rascal! The little scoundrel!" ((2006, 216) personify these boxes in a way that makes the parallel between their disorganization and his own internal memory‚Äôs poorly indexed structure more conspicuous. Further, they emphasise the box and the tapes as something distinctly ‚Äòother‚Äô from Krapp‚Äôs conception of himself; the clunkiness of the interface forces Krapp to recognize the alterity of these technological artifacts.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, he finds the third box, takes it down, rifles through the spools until he finds the desired fifth tape, and returns to the ledger. On the stage, this operation takes a significant amount of time; Krapp‚Äôs technological apparatus is mixed up and clanks and clatters in a way that undermines the smooth feedback loop endemic to a well-functioning inforg. Like his constipated digestive system, Krapp‚Äôs input-output stream is malfunctioning. The feedback loop between Krapp-as-conscious-mind and his own memories is just as unwieldy, as becomes clear in his perusal of the ledger‚Äôs entry. The precis ‚Äì "Mother at rest at last... hm... the black ball... the dark nurse.... slight improvement in bowel condition... hm... memorable.... what? Equinox, memorable equinox. Memorable equinox? Farewell to ‚Äì love" ‚Äì baffles him. The stage directions during his perusal repeat "puzzled" twice, has him staring blankly, and peering closely at the page to compensate for his nearsightedness. These notes fail to spark in him the memories they‚Äôre meant to point to. His bodily infirmity and his age isolate him from his own memories even with access to notes about them. The focus, then, on Krapp‚Äôs inability to access his own memories even with the help of written technological prostheses gestures towards his internal mind‚Äôs memory‚Äôs status as an apparatus to which his access is unreliable; if the tapes and the ledger‚Äôs status as an external adjunct to his memory turn his technology into a part of his mind, then this failure to recall, measured alongside the spool-search, technologises his biological memory by pointing to its own contingency, and thus dis-integrating the illusion of a unified subject.</p>

<p>Even while listening to his tape, Krapp‚Äôs access is flawed. Most obviously, Krapp is, according to the play‚Äôs stage directions, ‚Äòhard of hearing‚Äô (2006, 215) : Krapp‚Äôs faulty sensory apparatus increases further the opacity of the interface between himself and his externalised memories. Consider, too, the other apparatus he has recourse to: his "old dictionary." When he hears his past self talk about his mother‚Äôs "long viduity," he mouths the word with ‚Äòno sound.‚Äô The lack of sound stands here for the lack of meaning the word has for Krapp. He looks up the word, is puzzled by the germane definition ‚Äì the "state ‚Äì or condition ‚Äì of being ‚Äì or remaining ‚Äì a widow ‚Äì or widower"(2006, 219) and dwells, instead on the supplementary definition ‚Äì the "vidua bird," which he repeats with the same relish he has when revelling in the word "spoooooooool." Language here becomes a bodily thing, in the mouth and tongue, dissociated from its role as symbolic edifice. The <<define "noise" "Noise">> associated with the bodily execution of the text becomes more important than the <<define "signal" "Signal">> of the words' meaning.  The transmission of meaning fails to take place; instead, Krapp revels in the noise. Here we have another broken link in the cognitive chain; Krapp <<define "glitches" "Glitch">> like a malfunctioning algorithm.</p>

<p>Krapp thus presents a pessimistic picture of the too-often-utopian cyborg, and suggests that this same pessimism might be valid for humanity more broadly. If the active externalism of the extended mind holds, then those of us living in the information age are all to a greater or lesser degree inforgs - and there are signs in <i>Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape</i> that his reliance on technological prostheses has resulted in his own mechanization. His movements are modularised, like those of the figures in <i>[[Acts Without Words II]]</i> or <i>[[Quad]]</i>, and he compulsively repeats memories and even phrases. A danger, then, of outsourcing too much of one‚Äôs mind to technological devices in the external world might be that one becomes more like them, more mechanical. In <i>Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape</i>, Beckett presents a vision of an inforg whose malfunctioning biology puts the lie to any nostalgic yearning for a past with a unified and stable subject at its center. This holds even when the purpose of that externalization is, in Eric Levy‚Äôs words, "not to return to the past, but to define [Krapp‚Äôs] identity through the annual progression of perspectives on the past" (2002, 55). This vision is in tension with the memory Krapp returns to again and again: a nostalgic, sentimental moment where he, as a body, presses against another body, looks her in the eye, and says "let me in" (2006, 223).</p>

<p>Here, then, we have another paradox: Krapp‚Äôs mechanical memory offers him mediated access to an embodied and sentimental past while simultaneously alienating him from his body and from new experiences worth remembering. This anxiety is not new; it can be traced as far back as Plato‚Äôs [[Phaedrus]], where the technology of writing functions not as a "potion for memory and for wisdom" but instead "introduces forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it" because writing "is external and depends on signs that belong to others, instead of trying to remember from the inside" (551-552). The evolution of information communication technologies changes the interface by which recorded memory is accessed, and understanding those interfaces is critical to understanding the kinds of subjectivity they give rise to, but in both cases the technology is "a potion for reminding," not for remembering. What Plato misses but Beckett sees is that the disintegration of the body comes with a disintegration of the system of signs by which one remembers one‚Äôs own experience; remembering "from the inside" is just as prone to breakdown as memories encoded in language and embodied on technological platforms.</p>

<p>What conclusions, then, can be drawn about the contemporary inforg from the example of Krapp? First and foremost, the division between memories inside the skull - on <<define "wetware" "Wetware">>, to borrow William Gibson‚Äôs term - and those stored outside the skull on technological platforms is relevant only inasmuch as the opacity of the interface calls their platform specificity into question. In other words, because Krapp‚Äôs internal memory is no more or less accessible than his external, it makes sense to think about Krapp as a collection of interconnected cognitive systems that imbricates his failing body with his clunky tapes and his books. Krapp is only less of an inforg, in this reckoning, because the interfaces continually fail.</p>

<p>A more transparent interface shifts the information from vorhanden to zuhanden and in so doing dangerously obscures the degree to which the contemporary subject is interpolated into a technologically networked system.  Devoting close attention to the interfaces that integrate distinct cognitive platforms, biological and mechanical, is a powerful way to consider the kinds of subjectivity that arise out of these relationships, as is attentiveness to the particularities of the platforms in question. <I>Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape</I> slows information transfer down and embodies it in such a way that the informational transactions that take place any time cognitive systems are integrated with one another become an object of critique, and thus offers interface study and platform study as ways of thinking through the postcognitivist, postmodernist subject.</p>

<p>Krapp also demonstrates a central danger of overrelying on mediated memories to preserve the integrity of the subject separate from his or her world: a nostalgic obsession with a selectively curated version of the past. His obsession with this past, and his concomitant loss of the present, is an invisible epidemic in a technological moment where interfaces converge increasingly towards transparency.

<p>A 2019 The New York Times article titled the "Making of a YouTube Radical" charts how 26-year-old Caleb Cain - and, with him, a growing population of disaffected young white men - have come to rely on media technologies to construct a cohesive, nostalgic political identity. The article, which charts Cain‚Äôs fall "down the alt-right rabbit hole," describes a man who "fell asleep to YouTube videos at night, his phone propped up on a pillow." Cain listens to a series of voices from the so-called "alt-right" that weaponise rhetorical appeals to an imagined racial and nationalist past. Like for [[Krapp]] the goal is the construction of a stable self in the face of obliteration: the perceived decay of a fictional nostalgic construction of "Western civilization" of which he, as a white male in America, is the natural and disinherited heir. The "voice in the dark" is technologically mediated and grounded in sentimental nostalgia. These platforms provide an endless stream of digital content that functions as a public prosthetic memory which constitutes, in men like Cain, a nationalist political identity.</p>

<p>"The Making of a YouTube Radical" catalogues the role of Youtube‚Äôs algorithm and its alt-right content in "redpilling," or radicalizing, angry young men with content that valorises "traditional" conservative values drawn from an imagined American past. This radicalization is often violent. In a 2019 statement before Congress, Michael C. McGarrity, the Assistant Director of the FBI‚Äôs Counterterrorism Division, stated that "individuals adhering to racially motivated violent extremism have been responsible for the most lethal incidents among domestic terrorists in recent years, and [...] the threat of violence and lethality posed by racially motivated violent extremists will continue" (Confronting White Supremacy). Critically, these violent extremists "are increasingly using social media for the distribution of propaganda, recruitment, target selection, and incitement of violence."

<p>The platforms that broadcast the voices which radicalise Cain et al are engineered to be as frictionless as possible. Each user on YouTube, for example, has a profile that Google (which owns YouTube) uses to serve them content. These profiles track what their users watch and start to offer them other videos based on what it ‚Äòthinks‚Äô they will engage with. Because Google makes most of their money off of advertising that is itself tailored to user profiles, enormous incentives exist to keep users watching videos. YouTube accomplishes this goal in several ways. Firstly, when a video on YouTube ends, another one - chosen by an algorithm, rather than by the user - begins. Unlike [[Krapp‚Äôs tapes]], which must be taken from their tins and wound to the proper moment, it is easy to keep watching YouTube.</p>

Thirdly, YouTube (like all social networking platforms) hires an army of <<cycler "UI" "user interface">> and <<cycler "UX" "user experience">> designers who leverage a fantastic amount of user data to continually tweak the appearance, layout, and overall structure through which users view content.

<p>[[Clark and Chalmers]]‚Äô discussion of the constitutive role [[cognitive prostheses]] play in the [[extended mind]] is echoed in David Mogensen‚Äôs interview with Youtube‚Äôs UX lead, Scott Hines, who notes that he and his colleagues focus on "how YouTube aids people in their decision-making at every step of the journey across platforms" (2016). In other words, YouTube is a platform built with the idea of content, and design, driving behavior in addition to simply entertaining. This reciprocal relationship between viewer and content depends on "engagement" above all else. Critically, an engaged user is more financially valuable to YouTube, and so Google‚Äôs engineers are incentivised to privilege engagement above all else. This gives rise to products like Google‚Äôs "Reinforce" AI, which Roose calls a "long-term addiction machine [...] designed to maximise users‚Äô engagement over time by predicting which recommendations would expand their tastes and get them to watch not just one more video but many more." (2019). Indeed, according to Roose, the algorithm, which curates the user‚Äôs homepage and the "Up Next" sidebar that automatically plays at the termination of the previous video, accounts for more than 70% of all of the time spent on the website (2019). Unlike [[Krapp]], then, who ostensibly relies on his own ledger and his own will (whatever that means) to choose what tapes to listen to, a YouTube watcher in many ways has his or her ‚Äòtapes‚Äô chosen for them.</p>

<p>Engagement on YouTube does not just mean watching videos, however; it also means ‚Äòliking‚Äô and commenting on those videos and in so doing participating in and contributing to the community. Political scientist Jodi Dean has argued that this participatory model gives rise to "affective networks," "feedback loops [...] entrapping contemporary subjects" (2015, 90). Dean‚Äôs affective network has much in common with the extended mind, but diverges in its psychoanalytically inflected consideration of affect rather than cognition, drives rather than information, as the primary term in considering the subject; whatever the focus, however, the linkage between a user and their devices is tighter when the loop is two-way. Numerous studies have linked this mode of engagement with addiction to the platform; for example, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions found that "content creation in YouTube had a closer relationship with YouTube addiction than content viewing" and, further, that "social gratification was found to have a significant influence on both types of YouTube activities" (Balakrishnan).</p>

<p>Troublingly, the relationship between ideological extremity and high engagement seems to be linear; according to Manoel Ribeiro et al, whose 2019 study "Auditing Radicalization Pathways on YouTube" examines the radicalization pipeline from the so-called "Intellectual Dark Web" to the "alt-lite" and ultimately the "alt-right," more extreme content tends to have more engagement. This, coupled with the fact that users are more likely to return to content with which they have engaged, helps explain YouTube‚Äôs incentive to shepherd users from less to more extreme content. As Zeynep Tufecki wrote in a 2019 article in Scientific American, "YouTube‚Äôs algorithms will push whatever they deem engaging, and it appears they have figured out that wild claims, as well as hate speech and outrage peddling, can be particularly so." Maximizing engagement - and, in so doing, maximizing profit - maximises radicalization and addiction.</p>

<p>For Clark and Chalmers, the extended vision of the mind is not limited to a single individual; although they consider more natural prostheses like a notebook that a person with Alzheimer‚Äôs might use to keep track of their daily routine (like Krapp‚Äôs ledger), they also suggest that "a group of people brainstorming around a table" might be another situation where cognition extends beyond the skin. [[Visible only if you read Krapp]]Krapp‚Äôs case is interesting in part because his own reactions to his tapes highlights the very lack of self-identity over time that the tapes are meant to remedy: he finds it "hard to believe" he was "ever that young whelp. The voice! Jesus! The aspirations!" (2006, 218) and in his last tape refers to "that stupid bastard I took myself for thirty years ago, hard to believe I was ever as bad as that" (2006, 222). Indeed, this self-denunciation is a theme that develops as Beckett continues to write; what Krapp finds hard to believe, Not I‚Äôs Mouth finds horrifying. In a postcognitivist framework, Krapp can be read as a group of people reminiscing around a table - himself and his younger, increasingly distant selves. This reading strategy allows us to consider how the weaponization of mediated nostalgia that takes place on online platforms gives rise to an extended mind with prosthetic, collective memories of an imagined past. The material YouTube is engineered to push its users towards is fueled by a nostalgia analogous to Krapp‚Äôs own; however, because it is collective rather than individual, the recollected / invented past is a political one.</p>

<p>The particular imagined past constructed by the online alt-right offers a return to a time "before feminism," where gender roles were more firmly codified. This return manifests as an often-violent online misogyny directed at cisgendered women, trans individuals, queer folk in general, and so-called "beta" males whose performance of masculinity somehow falls short. One major funnel to the alt-right, according to sociologist Rebecca Lewis, is Jordan Peterson, a tenured professor of psychology at the University of Toronto who was described by David Brooks of The New York Times as the "most influential public intellectual in the Western world" (2018). Peterson has a YouTube channel with more than 150 million views and gained international prominence in large part due to his highly public opposition to Canada‚Äôs proposed Bill C-16, which bans discrimination against people on the basis of gender identity or gender expression. His opposition was recorded and broadcasted in a series of wildly popular videos where he stated his refusal to refer to transgender students by their chosen pronouns, calling it "radically politically correct thinking" (Beauchamp 2018).</p>

<p>His philosophy, such as it is, is a perfect encapsulation of the imagined past of alt-right: it is profoundly nostalgic and markedly hostile towards feminism, racial justice, women‚Äôs rights more broadly. He proudly states that white privilege is a farce, and in an interview with the New York Times prescribes "enforced monogamy" as the cure to violence committed by radicalized white men, arguing that "violent attacks are what happens when men do not have partners [...] and society needs to work to make sure those men are married" (Bowles 2018). Peterson accompanies this nostalgic return to a past where women‚Äôs bodies and sexuality are even more controlled by patriarchal authority with "imagery from a hundred years ago" - a penchant for three-piece suits, wide lapels, and self-consciously archaic speech patterns that he calls a rediscovered tradition and "prairie populism." In place of Krapp sitting in the dark recording tapes for himself, the well-lit Peterson records and broadcasts a fictionalised version of the past grounded in idiosyncratic interpretations of biblical texts, self-help bromides, and casual misogyny. Peterson‚Äôs success depends on the media technology that broadcasts his nostalgic vision onto the computers and smartphones of the Caleb Cains across the globe.</p>

<p>Peterson‚Äôs audience crosses over substantially with "Gamergate", which began in 2014 as a backlash against feminist indie game developer Zoe Quinn, feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian, and a broader perception that a previously white male cultural space ‚Äî video gaming ‚Äî was being taken over by so-called ‚Äòsocial justice warriors.‚Äô Cultural historian Kristin Bezio has convincingly connected Gamergate to the rise of the online alt-right and its "digital echo-chambers" (2018, 557) like 4chan, the corners of YouTube we‚Äôve been discussing, and the Reddit community "TheRedPill." This subreddit, which has been "quarantined" by Reddit for being "highly offensive or upsetting," defines feminism as "a doctrine of class hatred and violence" (2015) and defines the "Red Pill" itself as "the awareness of the dark truths surrounding human sexuality; hypergamy, women‚Äôs ‚ÄòAlpha Fucks / Beta Bucks‚Äô strategies, society‚Äôs Feminine Imperative" and so forth (2015). Roose‚Äôs article on Caleb Cain, who himself was "red-pilled," defines it more succinctly as "an internet slang term for converting to far-right beliefs" (2019).</p>

<p>It can be challenging to disentangle these different corners of the online alt-right from one another; most incels (short for "involuntary celibates", a label many of these disaffected white men affix to themselves) claim they‚Äôve been red-pilled, for example, and many of them participated in Gamergate. Indeed, controversial YouTuber gamer PewDiePie, whose YouTube channel has nearly 26 billion views, posted a positive video review of Jordan Peterson‚Äôs 12 Rules to Live By. What these groups share is a hatred of so-called "SJWs", or social justice warriors, which TheRedPill‚Äôs glossary defines as "individuals who involve themselves in some level of activism towards promoting a feminist or other equality-driven agenda [who] corrupt the idea of equality into misandry and the reduction of rights for white males" (2015). As hardly needs to be said at the time of this writing, the misogyny of the alt-right is inseparable from its racism, and both are rooted in nostalgia and propagated - or embodied - online.</p>

<p>What kind of subjectivity arises when Cain, for example, listens to well-heeled white nationalists like Richard Spencer describe a different kind of nostalgia, a counterfactual cultural memory of an imagined America? Krapp‚Äôs personal postmodern subjectivity is, in this latter case, swapped for a political subjectivity whose postmodern nature is masked by its self-conscious appeals to radical traditionalism and an outright hostility to postmodernity as such. As Laurie Ouellette and Sarah Banet-Weiser argue, "one of the primary characteristics of the extreme right is nostalgia for a particular kind of identity: the white, heterosexual man" (2018, 5). By appealing to this nostalgia, alt-right celebrities (or "influencers", as many internet celebrities are known) provide their listeners with the illusion of a stable identity. In Spencer‚Äôs own words,

<blockquote>I don‚Äôt need to tell black people in this room to have an identity because you all have got it. You know who you are. But I will tell that to white people. Have a goddamn identity. Have a sense of yourself. Be a part of this family. You are not an individual, you are not just an American, you are not just a citizen, you are part of this family. (Caplan 2016)</blockquote>

<p>Spencer‚Äôs rhetoric here dovetails with Cain‚Äôs own explanation for his transformation: "it appealed to me because it made me feel a sense of belonging" (Roose 2019). If Krapp‚Äôs personal memories as recorded on magnetic tape can be thought of as an externalised memory, and if that memory is the material he uses to try and cobble together an identity, then these voices in the dark serve a similar function. Unlike Krapp, whose personal identity is under threat from the ravages of time and his own presumably imminent demise, the alt-right imagines a collective identity under siege by an army of social justice warriors whose commitment to equality would consign them to the ashbin of history. In so doing, they create an affective network within which a contemporary postcognitivist subject can become radicalized.</p>

<p>I have here principally considered the negative potentialities that accompany the prostheticization of memory because we live in an historical moment where those negative possibilities seem so powerful and so omnipresent. The American alt-right is an apt example in relation to Krapp due to its rhetorical reliance on a nostalgia that links the prosthetic memory with the contemporary subject, but it is not the only one. Other communities exist online, with their own collective memories, their own postcognitive subjectivities - and, in many cases, their own collective imagined futures. These range from 4chan‚Äôs so-called hive mind, whose shared name "Anonymous" highlights the subsumation of the individual, to the glossiola of Twitter‚Äôs hashtag-oriented activism - and other modes of being in the Information Age. Beckett‚Äôs plays, with their embodiment of selves fractured in time and space and ultimate skepticism towards any natural unity of the self, are a powerful tool for understanding the fractured inforganic self.</p>


:: Krapp Footnote

This radical traditionalism would be all too familiar to a playwright whose time in Vichy exposed him to propaganda "on a scale unprecedented in France" (Jackson 2003, 253) via a network of media technologies that included radio programs, airdropped leaflets, posters, newspapers, radio programs, and newsreels. The propaganda disseminated under the banner of France‚Äê Actualit√©s Path√©‚ÄêGaumont was focused on "the revival of traditional culture" through the "celebration of France‚Äôs colonial empire" and the "so-called National Revolution, a series of socio-cultural initiatives meant to restore France‚Äôs moral and physical strength" (Bowles 2004, 52). Beckett lived with this propaganda; as William Davies remarks, "Vichy‚Äôs was a vision of France that Beckett would have detested for its authoritarian nationalism, reactionary traditionalism, and overt collaboration, but it was also a France in which he could be actively persecuted for his politics, social connections, and avant-garde cultural sensibilities" (2020, 4). This vision of France included as a central pillar a concern with a French masculinity "softened by contemporary French culture" in contrast to the "‚Äòmore national, more virile, more human‚Äô France of Vichy‚Äôs imagination" (qtd in Davies, 2020, 4). Like the American alt-right, the nostalgic nationalism of Vichy France unfavorably compared a contemporary masculinity in perceived decline through feminization with an imaginatively constructed hypermasculinity.[HS2] 

Davies has convincingly argued that "Samuel Beckett‚Äôs postwar depictions of physically debilitating and suffering bodies" in the Trilogy can be read as "oddly defiant, even resistant" to this imaginary Vichy ideal (2020, 1). Where Malone, however, states that he is "not much given to nostalgia" (MD 10), Krapp wonders aloud if he "could have been happy" in the memory he most revisits, a romantic encounter on a boat. His answer to his own rhetorical question - "Pah!" - might read alongside Beckett‚Äôs representation of Krapp‚Äôs debilitated body as a denunciation of that nostalgic impulse -  but, if so, it is a denunciation held in perpetual tension with Krapp‚Äôs inescapable obsession with his own more virile past. Other than his mention of Vespers, which itself recalls his childhood, nearly everything Krapp listens to and records is about either the process of recording and recollection. As Eric Levy puts it, a retrospective project that began as an attempt to "define his identity through the annual progression of perspectives on the past [...] backfires such that Krapp has no identity but through regretting the past and abdicating responsibility to identify through striving towards the future" (2002, 55). This is partly a function of the topic of the play - it is no surprise that Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape spends most of its time on Krapp‚Äôs tape - but it demonstrates the degree to which Krapp‚Äôs obsession with the past cannibalises his present and the "present" of his previous recordings, which themselves spend most of their time on that process of recording. The vehicle of this obsession is the tapes that externalise Krapp‚Äôs personal memories as a cognitive prosthesis.

<p>Samuel Beckett's <i>Quad</i> "was first transmitted in Germany by S√ºddeutscher Rundfunk in 1982 under the title <i>Quadrat 1 + 2</i>. It was first transmitted by BBC2 on 16 December 1982. First published by Faber and Faber, London, in 1984" <<cite "450" "Beckett, Samuel. The Complete Dramatic Works.">>. It is a piece for four dancers, each wearing different colored robe, tracing out a repetitive pattern on a grey stage with a black backdrop. The dancers exhaust every possible permutation of these patterns, and then the screen fades to black, after which the lights come back up on the same dancers tracing the same pattern, but slowly, without percussion or color.</p>

<p>Indeed, Beckett was working in information before the information age. Whereas the masters of high modernism depended on and were informed by what Hugh Kenner in <i>The Mechanic Muse</i> called "transparent technology." Kenner argues that Beckett carried modernism "into the intangible realm of information theory‚Ä¶ our present world of enigmatic 'text,' of foregrounded codes and redundancies, of microchips through which what moves may be less interesting than the process of moving it elegantly" <<cite "15" "Kenner, Hugh. The Mechanic Muse.">>. <<define "Information" "Information">> is a complicated term to define - see the note for a more robust attempt at definition. Provisionally, here, I will proceed with Luciano Floridi‚Äôs definition ‚Äì that is, information is well-ordered, meaningful data <<cite "8" "Floridi, Luciano. Information: A Very Short Introduction.">>. I agree with Kenner, and further argue that <i>Quad</i>‚Äôs script can be productively read like a ‚Äòscript‚Äô in the programming sense ‚Äì in the same way that Kenner <<excerpt "transcribed" "Watt to Pascal">> sections of <i>Watt</i> into Pascal code - or, more recently and thoroughly, Nick Montfort wrote <i>[[Megawatt->Megawatt 1]]</i>.</p>

<p>Quad‚Äôs <<excerpt "script" "Quad script">> is, in this reading, a code, a set of mechanical instructions to be carried out one after another without deviation. The mathematical vectors described by Beckett‚Äôs very specific commands are drawn out geometrically. Beckett‚Äôs descriptions of the courses and the series, too, encode instructions for human behavior in symbolic language: "Course 1: AC, CB, BA, AD, DB, BC, CD, DA... 1st series (as above): 1, 13, 134, 1342, 342, 42, 2..." What Quad‚Äôs encoding of human gesture into symbolic form calls attention to is the way that all scripts function according to the same economy of symbol and gesture, whereby the playwright‚Äôs instructions are translated into words, which are in turn "executed" by the players. Quad interrogates the agency of the actor and the tyranny of the playwright/director under this symbolic regime; Quad‚Äôs similarity to computer code, then, emphasizes the ideal of the [[automatic play->Automatic Play]], one that runs without a <span class="glitch" data-text="glitch">glitch</span>, in perfect obedience to the will of the author. </p>

:: Automatic Play {"position":"3020,2339","size":"100,100"}
Proceeding from the <<define "schematic" "Informatic Schematic">> whereby the author's will is transcoded, through multiple lossy stages, into the gestures of actors upon a stage (and then to an audience's phenomenological experience of 'the play'), the dream of the 'automatic play' is one whereby each transcoding is totally lossless. 

That is:

* the author's will is captured perfectly by a definitive script that leaves no room for interpretative divergence;
* the director exectutes the script as doggedly as a computer running a Python script;
* the actors follow the instructions of the script and the director perfectly; and
* the audience is perfectly attentive and perfectly receptive.

This automatic play is, however, an illusion whose premises reinscribe a Platonic notion of a play that exists as pure form and is always already corrupted by its embodiment on a stage. That said, it is an illusion with an intellectual and dramatic pedigree. 

Consider Heinrich von Kleist's piece "<<excerpt "On the Marionette Theater" "Kleist, Heinrich von. On the Marionette Theater.">>", where his interlocutor posits the superiority of the marionette to the flesh-and-blood performer. If "the last trace of human volition could be removed from the marionettes and their dance transferred entirely to the realm of mechanical forces... he could perform a dance with it that neither he nor any other skilled dancer of his time ... could equal." 

In 1902, in <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/49611/49611-h/49611-h.htm#Page_93">Samhain</a></i>, W. B. Yeats imagined actors restrained in barrels: "[I] had once asked a dramatic company to let me rehearse them in barrels that they might forget gesture and have their minds free to think of speech for a while. The barrels, I thought, might be on castors, so that I could shove them about with a pole when the action required it."

Beckett took this idea further; see, for example, the urn-entombed characters of <i>Play</i>, or <i>Endgame</i>'s Hamm, pushed across the stage on castors. 

(Add more scholarship here. This might need to be broken up into a multi-part footnote.)

<p>Of course, one of the tensions constitutive of <i>Quad</i> is the way this symbolic operation is never "perfect," as <<define "traces" "Trace">> of the actor and their agency always remain even in the most faithful iteration of the teleplay. What develops is a tension between, as Piotr Woycicki puts it, "a formal, aesthetic ideal and its failure of realisation in live performance... the pure formalism is unachievable in performance since the live bodies resist the imposition of such rigid formal structures" <<cite "144" 'Woycicki, Piotr. Mathematical Aesthetic as a Strategy for Performance: A Vector Analysis of Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Quad.'>>. This translation of vectors into human gesture is not perfect, conditioned by the constitutive imperfection of the human body. Beckett‚Äôs script even allows for "time lost at angles and centre" <<cite "453" "Beckett, Samuel. Quad.">> ‚Äì any body, even the ballet dancers that the script calls for, is going to necessarily misstep. Hence the necessity of the human body for the successful production of <i>Quad</i>; <i>Quad</i> itself dramatizes the tension between the script and its realization.</p>

<p>Yet <i>Quad</i> is a teleplay, not a play, and thus lacks the immediacy of the human body that would seem to emphasize this constitutive frailty. The dancers in Quad are both bodies and not-bodies, translated by their televisual medium into "<<excerpt "the illusion of presence created by a pulsating beam of light moving rapidly across and down the face of a picture tube" "From The Skriker">>" <<cite "374" "Klaver, Elizabeth. 'Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Ohio Impromptu, Quad, and What Where: How It Is in the Matrix of Text and Television.'">>. The human body in <i>Quad</i> undergoes, then, a series of [[translations->Quad translations]]: the bodies of the dancers run the code of the script and translate authorial will into gesture, their bodies are filmed, the film is copied, the copies are broadcast, and so on. The human body is more and more alien after every step, having existed in representations incomprehensible to a human. The distance between the human subject watching the television and the dancer grows with every step save the initial, when the bodies ‚Äòrun‚Äô the textual script.</p>

This is how <i>Quad</i> works per my [[informatic->Informatic Schematic]] way of reading theatrical transcoding:
* Samuel Beckett writes the script;
* The script is disseminated
* The actors, with the help of the director, gesture the script into being on the stage;
* The camera records the actor; 
* The camera's tapes are copied;
* The copies are broadcasted over the airwaves to the television;
* The television is watched by the audience.

<p>Now, most people who now watch <i>Quad</i> do so on their computers ‚Äì either through a local file, as bits that are themselves translated electrical variances saved locally, or streamed from data saved on a server in a bunker somewhere. Still, traces of the human remain a vital part of the teleplay ‚Äì shuffling bodies invite empathy, identification, disgust, fear, the dancers sometimes shuffle more or less quickly, one can begin to identify secondary gender characteristics under the robes (or, at least, try to).

<p>Computer science offers a provocative way of reading these translations. In <i>The Language of New Media</i>, Lev Manovich calls the translation of media into code, and code into media, <<define "transcoding" "Transcoding">>. What I‚Äôd like to focus on here is how transcoding is often a <<define "lossy" "Loss">> process. The translation of <<define "data" "Data">> for preservation in the database or for transmission over the internet almost always results in the loss of some of the original data. Another way of thinking about lossiness is ‚Äòreversability‚Äô ‚Äì any transcoding of an object from one medium to another is lossless if it is reversible ‚Äì if one can transcode back to the original medium without any loss of fidelity ‚Äì but is lossy if it is not reversible ‚Äì if data is irreparably lost in the compression of translation. <i>Quad</i> stages lossy translation ‚Äì from the code of the script to the gesture of the dancer‚Äôs body, from the gesture to the camera, the camera to the broadcast device, and so on; any instance of Quad has undergone those translations, has lost fidelity from the original broadcast.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we cannot think about a loss of fidelity ‚Äì an imperfect translation of authorial will into text-as-stimulus for the reader ‚Äì as a purely subtractive move without buying into an idealistic idea of a ‚Äòpure‚Äô original text that Beckett‚Äôs work both attracts and repels. When the data gets [[cognized->Critique of Judgment]] by the viewer and assembled into information ‚Äì into the text ‚Äì the historically specific and contingent textual object which bears the marks of entropy ‚Äì <<define "audiovisual fuzziness, a loss of color" "noise">>, and so on ‚Äì that reassembled text is not necessarily ‚Äòless‚Äô than the original text. In the case of Beckett, whose work shows a consistent preoccupation with the particularity of the presentation of his work, the fuzziness of the degraded tape might be read as extension of the text itself. <i>Quad II</i>, the second half of <i>Quad</i> meant to take place ten-thousand years later, is in this reading the n‚Äôth degree of this loss.</p>

<p>In other words, each one of these translations loses some data along the way, and <i>Quad</i>, taken together with <i>Quad II</i>, seems attuned to this degradation. However, the process is not merely subtractive. New creative work is done when the Beckettian text is transcoded. In addition, then, to the hermeneutic of loss, it is worth looking at what new interpretive strategies become possible in light of new adaptations. This reading strategy of tabulating what is lost and what is gained specifically enacts what Stephen Connor calls the "complex play between reduction and addition, in which to repeat oneself, and therefore to say progressively less, seems, uncannily, always to involve saying more" <<cite "11" "Connor, Steven.

<p>What happens, then, when <i>Quad</i> is transcoded to thoroughgoing ‚Äònew media‚Äô? There is of course a loss any time the teleplay is removed from its original context inasmuch as it is less ‚Äòtrue‚Äô to the will of the author, particularly for someone as concerned with the specificity of the medium as Beckett was. On the other hand, translating <i>Quad</i> to a digital medium can accentuate those elements present in the original work that lend themselves to such a translation: their algorithmic character, the translation of human body into signal, the repetition, and the potential (theoretical, at least) ‚Äòfilling in‚Äô of the ellipsis indicated by the fade-out just before <i>Quad II</i>, which indicates a gap of ten-thousand years.</p>

<p>EndlessGame is not the only digital adaptation of <i>Quad</i>.</p>

<p>In his [[article in the September 2012 issue of Samuel Beckett Studies->Woycicki, Piotr. Mathematical Aesthetic as a Strategy for Performance: A Vector Analysis of Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Quad.]], Piotyr Woycicki writes about an adaptation he created. He links to <a target="_blank" href="http://pwoycicki.wix.com/quad">his own website</a>, which houses a Flash implementation of a program made in QBasic. Unfortunately, modern browsers can't run Flash and modern operating systems can't run applications written in QBasic. Less than 8 years later, the adaptation is <a target="_blank" href = "assets/pdfs/acid_free_bits.pdf">already obsolete.</a> His adaptation uses <<define "keyframes" "Keyframes">> rather than <<define "motion-capture data" "Motion-capture data">>.</p>

<p>The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, out of Carnegie Mellon University produced an <a target="_blank" href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/project/quad">adaptation</a> in 2011 that straddles the line between virtual and physical. Director <a target="_blank" href="https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/people/matt-gray">Matt Gray</a> used four iCreate (Roomba) robots and computer vision software to implement <i>Quad</i> as code and embody it. As the summary of their project suggests, the adaptation ends up revealing each robot's "subtle quirks and characteristics as individuals." Again, the constituitive drama of the production ends up being how the actors necessarily fail at implementation.</p>

<p>Using bodies of digital origin (as opposed to viewing bodies that have been digitized) forecloses certain modes of reading and opens up some others. Where the viewer of <i>Quad</i> can attempt to distinguish between the figures beyond their clothing, identify individualized gais, and try to infer their sex, the viewer of EndlessGame cannot because the avatars do not exceed their purpose as executors of the script in the same way that human bodies do. This attenuates the tension between the perfect pattern and its imperfect execution that Woycicki sees as the "focus of the performance" <<cite "140" 'Woycicki, Piotr.

<p>On the other hand, there are certain possibilities that a program can instantiate that the televisual version could not; Beckett‚Äôs instruction regarding lighting, for example, which were abandoned for technical reasons, is possible in the adaptation. The programmed version can continue to run long after dancers would starve (hence its name). Indeed, for one week in 2019 I ran EndlessGame as a looped stream on my Twitch channel. It was not very popular. Each iteration of the program does not degrade, unlike the imperfect play of bodies on the televisual screen. Unless specifically programmed to do so, the gradual ten-thousand-year crawl towards silence that takes place between <i>Quad</i> and <i>Quad II</i> does not take place in <i>EndlessGame</i>. That said, even ‚Äì maybe especially ‚Äì digital texts like this are contingent; technology changes quickly, and programs are constantly being made inaccessible. As Nick Montfort and Noah Wardrip-Fruin write in "<a target="_blank" href = "assets/pdfs/acid_free_bits.pdf">Acid-Free Bits</a>", "a piece of electronic literature written for a Macintosh in the 1980s may be unreadable on the Macs in a college computer lab today."</p>

<p>The actors move at a constant speed, unless the viewer decides to become a player and adjusts the speed, lighting, or camera perspective via commands provided at boot. Adding interactivity to the piece of course changes it ‚Äì it‚Äôs less ‚Äòfaithful.‚Äô One major element that separates the original <i>Quad</i> from a stage-play is the fixed camera, which forces the viewer to see one thing; being able to ‚Äòlook around‚Äô from the ‚Äòdanger zone‚Äô is a very different experience and has a very different (but similarly disorienting) effect. The ‚Äòplayer‚Äô can also choose to follow a single dancer, in which case a camera is activated in the dancer‚Äôs hood. These different camera views create different structures of identification with the dancers themselves: from above, they are small; from the middle, they are menacing; from inside, they are (ideally, at least) easier to identify with. These effects are, idealy, enhanced in the virtual reality port of the game; from personal experience, the sensation of standing in the middle of <i>Quad</i> is a deeply unnerving one.</p>

<p>My assumption was that computerized models moving according to a deterministic program (written in C#; the code is available <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.especiallygreatliterature.com/endlessgame_code.cs">here</a>) would result in the ‚Äòperfect‚Äô execution of Beckett‚Äôs code ‚Äì and it did, when cubes were used in place of actors. However, as soon as the cubes were replaced with humanoid avatars and animated, the project became much more complicated Animation of humanoid avatars in Unity requires several components: an avatar-object, which is a three-dimensional model ‚Äòrigged‚Äô with a skeleton and a musculature in order to make movement realistic; and animation data, which can be generated either via keyframes or motion-capture data. [[Piotyr Woycicki‚Äôs adaptation->Digital Adaptations of Quad]], according to his documentation, animates his actors via <<define "keyframes" "Keyframes">>, whereby the creator manually poses the actor for each frame and then runs the frames together like an animated cartoon.</p>

<p>With Unity, however, animation can be made more realistic by use of motion-capture data, which is provided free-of-charge with the personal edition of the free software. <<define "Motion-capture data" "Motion-capture data">> is acquired by filming anonymous human actors in outfits covered in sensors. The sensors relay information about the gestures to computers, which convert that information to a series of vector values, each associated with a different part of the skeleton. Animating a figure in Unity, therefore, translates real human motion into code, and then applies that human motion to an artificial body. These animation clips are cut up so the steps loop properly. They are modularized and then looped to replicate apparent human motion; breaking up animations to look ‚Äònatural‚Äô paradoxically requires the modularization of artificial, inhuman clips. Applying the human animations to the default avatars knocked the code off-track ‚Äì as soon as translated human gesture was returned to the system, it stopped being ‚Äòperfect‚Äô and required several lines of code to keep the actors from missing their cues.</p>

<p>A proper game version, where a player can control a dancer and attempt to ‚Äòexecute‚Äô the code of the game, would encourage still another kind of identification ‚Äì and in so doing move us further away from the ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô text. <<define "Loss">> seems like the wrong word to use here, however, as what‚Äôs taking place is an opening up of possibilities. Unlike the process of lossy transcoding discussed earlier, transcoding <i>Quad</i> to EndlessGame permits a variety of novel ways of experiencing an extant text. This opening-up of possibilities underlines the way that <i>Quad</i> itself, by virtue of its Beckettian principal of subtraction ‚Äì the minimal ‚Äòcontent‚Äô in the play, the repeated, simple pattern ‚Äì calls attention to the constitutive role that the viewer has in making ‚Äòsense‚Äô of it ‚Äì of turning the <<define "data" "Data">> into <<define "information" "Information">>, in other words.</p>

<p><i>Quad</i>‚Äôs dramatization of the way that each repetition of a gesture loses some meaning, that each copy signifies less, parallels provocatively the process by which <i>Quad</i> is disseminated into the world as a series of increasingly damaged copies, steps on the way to the quiet of <i>Quad II</i> and, projecting forward, the silence and stillness of a hypothetical <i>Quad III</i>. The way that this emptying out of meaning forces the viewer to make some sense of the patterns in the teleplay and unify it under some interpretive framework ‚Äì synthesize the [[data into information]] ‚Äì is emphasized in <i>EndlessGame</i>, where the viewer has the power to actually change the pattern in minute ways that do not, ultimately, ‚Äòchange‚Äô what happens. However, <<define "loss" "Loss">> falls short as a way of thinking about this recombinatory power of the human mind, the way that reading strategies themselves depend not on a text‚Äôs fidelity to an idealized original but the degree to which they suggest something to the reader. What creating an adaptation of <i>Quad</i>, or ‚Äòplaying‚Äô <i>EndlessGame</i>, ultimately calls attention to is the authorial role that the viewer has in the presence of the text, and suggests a way of thinking about reading as the ordering of <<define "data" "Data">> into <<define "meaning" "Meaning">> ‚Äì the running of a code. Interpretation then becomes the flipside of loss, the way that meaning, having been emptied out via repetition, re-enters the system.</p>

<p>Analogously, this kind of reading strategy offers a new way to look at what happens to human body under the sign of <<define "information" "Information">> rather than mere corporality ‚Äì that is, when the body is transcoded and compressed into machine-readable, numerical information and then re-translated and expanded into a human-readable format, and how the gestures thereby translated persistently mean. In the Information Age, this traffic between the algorithmic and the human is ubiquitous. Human interaction increasingly takes place on digital stages. The grandmother sees her grandchild primarily via Skype, where both faces are blurred by compression algorithms ensuring temporal near-simultaneity over a long distance; individuals curate a particular set of digital photographs and posts and present themselves on social media platforms, thereby transcoding themselves into an assimilation of quanta of social gesture; warfare takes place remotely, with drones controlled by user interfaces not completely dissimilar from a video game. If identity is constituted by repeated stylizations of the body what happens when the body is electric - that is, as a self-stylized <<define "avatar" "Avatar">> in a virtual world rather than as the <<define "meat" "Meatspace">> into which we are born? By thinking about what is lost and what is gained in Beckettian works where the human is transcoded, successfully or unsuccessfully, into code, we can think productively about what is lost and gained when we perform the same translation on our selves.</p>

<i>[[Not I]]</i> effects a complex mechanization of its actor. Critically, this mechanization is not a disembodiment; instead, <i>Not I</i> forces its actor to "employ every cell", in [[Lisa Dwan]]‚Äôs words, to "push the sound out [...] at the speed of thought." The body of the ideal Beckettian actor becomes a mechanical medium, an [[automaton->automatic play]] programmed to execute Beckett‚Äôs script with metronomic precision. The actor‚Äôs mechanization is paralleled by Mouth‚Äôs own repeated references to her own [[biological body as a machine]]; as Hannah Simpson puts it, "both Mouth and the actor are positioned as mechanical tools that exist solely to articulate another‚Äôs text" <<cite '2015' 'Simpson, Hannah.

Samuel Beckett's play <i>[[Not I]]</i> was "written in English in spring 1972. First performed at the Forum Theater of the Lincoln Center, New York, in September 1972. First published by Faber and Faber, London, in 1973. First performed in Britain at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 16 January 1973." <<cite "374" "Beckett, Samuel. The Complete Dramatic Works.">> Live, the play is generally staged in a totally dark theater save for a single spotlight illuminating the Mouth of the actress, who speaks the play's script at a breakneck pace. The script also calls for an Auditor, who is often omitted from actual performances.

<p>Nick Montfort‚Äôs 2014 project <i>Megawatt</i> carries the algorithmic sections of Watt to their nth degree. Megawatt itself is the title of both a computer program ‚Äì a several-hundred-line <a target="_blank" href="assets/code_snippets/megawatt.py">Python script</a> also available on <a target="_blank" href="http://nickm.com/code/megawatt.py">his own site</a> ‚Äì and the <a target="_blank" href="assets/pdfs/megawatt.pdf">output of that program</a>, which (according to the documentation at the head of both the script and the output) "in many ways is like a standard novel" and, per the code's documentation,</p>

<blockquote>"leaves aside all of the more intelligible language of Beckett‚Äôs novel and is based, instead, on that which is most systematic and inscrutable. It does not just recreate these passages, although with minor changes the Megawatt code can be used to do so. In the new novel, rather, they are intensified by generating, using the same methods that Beckett used, significantly more text than is found in the already excessive Watt."</blockquote>

<p>The novel version of Megawatt can, as of this writing, be purchased via the Harvard Bookstore‚Äôs Print On Demand service ‚Äì that is, the Harvard Bookstore will run the code and print the output of the script like a traditional novel. This process recalls what Wai Chee Dimock writes about the status of the print novel in the Information age: "the fluid sequences flitting across the computer screen are not containers of meaning or data but sets of rules (algorithms) for generating themselves" <<cite '1378' 'Dimock, Wai Chee. "Introduction: Genres as Fields of Knowledge."'>>. Both the novel and the source code, however, are a ‚Äòpart‚Äô of the text; as N. Katherine Hayles, referencing the work of Loss Peque√±o Glazer, Matthew Kirschenbaum, John Cayley, and Matthew Fuller, <a target="_blank" href="https://eliterature.org/pad/elp.html">argues</a>, "code must be considered as much a part of the ‚Äòtext‚Äô of electronic literature as the screenic surface" <<cite '35' 'Hayles, N. Katherine. "Electronic Literature: What is it?"'>>.</p>

<p>A few problems immediately present themselves when trying to think about <i>Megawatt</i> alongside <i>Watt</i>. At first glance, it might make more sense to compare <i>Megawatt</i> (the novel) with Watt; they share a medium and a language. However, the code of <i>Megawatt</i> can be tweaked, by moving around a handful of pound signs, to accurately reproduce the sections in <i>Watt</i> from which it is drawn. For example, the relevant snippet of code for <i>Megawatt</i>‚Äôs intensification of the voices passage in <i>Watt</i> is as follows:</p>

<code>## In Watt the voices = [‚Äòsang‚Äô, ‚Äòcried‚Äô, ‚Äòstated‚Äô, ‚Äòmurmured‚Äô]<br>
\## And Watt understood = [‚Äòall‚Äô, ‚Äòmuch‚Äô, ‚Äòlittle‚Äô, ‚Äònothing‚Äô]<br>
\## Here the voices did eight things and there are eight levels:<br>
voices = [‚Äòsang‚Äô, ‚Äòcried‚Äô, ‚Äòstated‚Äô, ‚Äòmurmured‚Äô, ‚Äòbabbled‚Äô, ‚Äòchattered‚Äô, ‚Äòranted‚Äô, ‚Äòwhispered‚Äô]<br>
understood = [‚Äòall‚Äô, ‚Äòmost‚Äô, ‚Äòmuch‚Äô, ‚Äòhalf‚Äô, ‚Äòlittle‚Äô, ‚Äòless‚Äô, ‚Äòbits‚Äô, ‚Äònothing‚Äô]</code>

<p>The hash marks # indicate a ‚Äòcomment‚Äô ‚Äì that is, a metatextual element of the programming language that is there not for the computer but for the human reader of the code. Good code is itself text, layered with computer instructions and with human-readable documentation that clarifies the function of the computer code. The brackets indicate the initialization of a ‚Äòlist,‚Äô which is a kind of data structure that can contain a series of elements (here, ‚Äòstrings,‚Äô or series of characters ‚Äì words, sentences, and so on). The commented lines provide the code to initialize the lists one would need to replicate <i>Watt</i>: that is, there are four kinds of voices ([‚Äòsang‚Äô,‚Äôcried‚Äô,‚Äôstated‚Äô,‚Äômurmured‚Äô]) and four kinds of understanding. Replacing the contents of the longer lists at the bottom of the provided code ‚Äì where the voices also babble, chatter, rant, and whisper ‚Äì would cause the program‚Äôs output to replicate the section in <i>Watt</i> rather than expanding it as <i>Megawatt</i> does. One can also add more words to the existing list; the voices could also yammer, bicker, ballyhoo, and so on. A hypothetical <i>Gigawatt</i> could, without much programming, search the dictionary for every verb that describes an <<define "utterance">> and automatically generate a voice for every word; the resulting text would stretch for millions of pages, and would still (correctly) end with the warning that these were only some of the voices.</p>

<i>Megawatt</i> expressly lays out the algorithm by which those sections of <i>Watt</i> might be composed. A reader who goes to the code rather than the novel has the interpretive work that Elizabeth Drew and Mads Haahr point to ‚Äì that is, the work the reader does in "sorting through the randomness and patterns in the text" in order to derive meaning ‚Äì done for them <<cite '4' 'Drew, Elizabeth and Haahr, Mads. "Lessness: Randomness, Consciousness and Meaning."'>>. On the other hand, the act of decoding the code, parsing the comments, and then running the code on their own computer places the reader into a uniquely authorial position, whereby not merely the meaning but the words themselves that make up the pseudo-Beckettian text are generated as a direct consequence of their own agency. This new role for the reader is reflected in the licensing information that accompanies all of Montfort‚Äôs new media objects, each of which is explicitly licensed as free software ‚Äì a declaration "which many authors of digital work share," and which "goes beyond the traditional concept of authorship and copyright, inviting readers to participate creatively‚Ä¶ Transferring literature to electronic media has changed the status of the reader, bringing him/her closer to the position of author than a reader of conventional literature" <<cite "86" "Malecka, Aleksandra and Marecki, Piotr. 'Hyper-constrained: Translating Nick Montfort's Textual Generators'">> . Megawatt is licensed under the Open Source Initiative‚Äôs "[[ISC License]]," which gives full permission to "use, copy, modify, and/or distribute" the work provided that the copyright notice appears in all copies. Contrast this to Beckett and his estate, for whom the work of art is proprietary, carefully curated, and litigiously protected. This shifting ethos as regards the control that the creator of the work of art has over the work‚Äôs adaptations and afterlives is indicative of a larger shift that has taken place as regards the status of the [[work of art in the age of mechanical and informational reproduction->Benjamin, Walter. "The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility."]]: away from the author and towards the authors.

The algorithm from which the "short statement" about the "poor old lousy earth" can be written and rewritten is a manageable, human-readable piece of code that can be close-read like one might close-read the novel itself. In <i>Watt</i>, the statement goes three generations deep ‚Äì i.e. from "my earth and my father‚Äôs and my mother‚Äôs.... and my father‚Äôs father‚Äôs father‚Äôs," exhausting every possible combination of the two terms ‚Äòfather‚Äô and ‚Äòmother‚Äô for each generation. In <i>Megawatt</i>, the operation is extended to the sixth generation ‚Äì i.e. to "my mother‚Äôs mother‚Äôs mother‚Äôs mother‚Äôs mother‚Äôs mother‚Äôs" and so on. The code to produce this operation is as follows:

<code>
text.append('Inside were Mr Knott and Erskine and another. Before ' +
&emsp;'leaving, this gentleman made the following short statement:')
para = 'And the poor old lousy earth, my earth'
def ancestor(depth):
&emsp;if depth < 1:
&emsp;&emsp;yield "
&emsp;else:
&emsp;&emsp;for parent in [' father‚Äôs', ' mother‚Äôs']:
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for grandparent in list(ancestor(depth - 1)):
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;yield parent + grandparent
for possessive in ['my', 'other people‚Äôs']:

\## Originally this is done for three generations, i.e.:<br>
\##   for i in range(1,4)<br>
\## Here the number of generations are doubled, so there are six:
&emsp;for i in range(1,7):
&emsp;&emsp;elders = ancestor(i)
&emsp;&emsp;for elder in list(elders):
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;para = para + ' and ' + possessive + elder
para = para + '.'
text.append(para)
</code>

First, to parse: ‚Äòappend‚Äô is a function that takes as its parameter a string (that is, takes the parenthetical text that follows its invocation) and adds that parameter to the list that calls it. So  <code>text.append("New Entry")</code> would make a new entry in the list named "text" that holds the string <code>New Entry</code>. <code>para</code> is the string variable where the code holds the generated lines that will be added to the <code>text</code> list and worked on through the rest of the code. <code>def ancestor(depth):</code> declares a new function ‚Äì a new set of instructions that takes as a parameter an integer "depth" (how many generations deep we want, in this case) ‚Äì and ‚Äòyields‚Äô the sentence in Wattese. Notably, the ancestor function is recursive; it calls itself within itself until the depth is exhausted <code>(if depth < 1)</code>. The ‚Äòfor‚Äô loop simply runs until all of the conditions have been met ‚Äì <code>for parent in [‚Äòfather‚Äôs‚Äô, mother‚Äôs‚Äô]</code>, for example, runs the code that follows with ‚Äòfather‚Äôs‚Äô as a parameter and then ‚Äòmother‚Äôs‚Äô as a parameter. The loops actually start running with the line <code>for possessive in [‚Äòmy‚Äô, ‚Äòother people‚Äôs‚Äô]:</code>; it runs twice, first for ‚Äòmy‚Äô ancestors and then for ‚Äòother peoples‚Äô‚Äô ancestors. Each time it runs, it goes through the ancestor-code from depths 1 through 6 (<code>for i in range(1,7)</code>). The ancestors function generates a list of ancestors, which are added to the ‚Äòpara‚Äô variable sequentially at <code>for elder in list(elders)</code>; and then all of this output is written to the larger list <code>text</code> with the last provided line.

This code is, hard as it might be to believe for someone without a coding background, remarkably human-readable and straightforward. There are lucid comments that explain where the constants 1 and 7 come from in the main loop, and Montfort uses variable names that make it clear what each variable stands in for, and what each list contains. For a programmer, then, this algorithm expresses the ‚Äòpattern‚Äô that the reader is encouraged to decode when they read <i>Watt</i>. Further, it allows for the possibility of indefinitely extended iterations of the algorithm provided by the original novel. Changing the "7" to "10," for example, carries out the operation to 9 generations rather than 6, which would in turn take up a great deal more space. That this part of the original text, along with other parts of Watt, can be formalized like this gestures towards the statement made just after the ‚Äòshort statement‚Äô ‚Äì that: 
<blockquote>"if I could begin it all over again, knowing what I know now, the result would be the same. And if I could begin again a third time, knowing what I would know then, the result would be the same. And if I could begin it all over again a hundred times, knowing each time a little more than the time before, the result would always be the same, and the hundredth life as the first, and the hundred lives as once. A cat‚Äôs flux. But at this rate we shall be here all night"</blockquote>

In other words, that which happens, happens again, and will continue to happen in a cursed recursion. What breaks the loop here is a few lines of poetry that results in a "Haw!" of laughter. Something affective ‚Äì comedy ‚Äì challenges the determinism of these logical structures that only seem to end where they do rather than, as they do in <i>Megawatt</i>, hundreds of pages later because to continue would exhaust the reader/listener. Of course, the subsequent statement made by <i>Watt</i>‚Äôs interlocutor tabulates the "laughs that strictly speaking are not laughs, but modes of ululation" ‚Äì "the bitter, the hollow, and the mirthless" ‚Äì and so on. Even that experience which exceeds tabulation is subject to the endless ratiocination and categorization of the broken mind-machines of <i>Watt</i>. Formalizing the algorithms that entrap Watt‚Äôs experience underscores the degree to which they leave something important out, the fundamentally impoverished state of language under the sign of the mechanical formula, and what Culik calls "descriptive (in)sufficiency of language" and "the (in)ability of a formal system to comprehend itself" (132). On the other hand, theorists of electronic literature and new media have pointed to randomization and automated texts as potentially liberatory; the process of <i>Megawatt</i>, whereby the reader, the compiler, the computer, the coder, and Beckett work in tandem to generate a new text, might, as Hayles puts it in a discussion of electronic literature, both reflect and enact "a new kind of subjectivity characterized by distributed cognition, networked agency that includes human and nonhuman actors, and fluid boundaries dispersed over actual and virtual locations" (37). Under this reading, we might think about how Megawatt fashions an "intermediation between computer code and human-only language, digital and analogue processing, and print and electronic media forms" (135) ‚Äì about how porous the membrane becomes between author and reader, and how that porousness is reflected in many features of the new media landscape.

:: Practice-Based Research Introduction / Overview / Methodology [pbr] {"position":"3044,1068","size":"100,100"}
The past two decades have seen an explosion of methodologies whereby scholars produce research through creation. These methodologies span a wide range and are intrinsically interdisciplinary, but do share several features that make them useful for the purposes of this chapter, including the prioritization of "embodied knowledges" (P+K 117) over written research, more. Although terminological disputes proliferate, I will categorize these methodologies under the umbrella term of ‚Äòpractice as research,‚Äô a part of what David Whitton calls a "practical turn" in theater studies whereby creative work should be considered a "valid research process and/or a research outcome" (78). This practical turn is a controversial one, with both pragmatic and epistemological consequences associated with it; indeed, much of the literature on the topic citations focuses less on examples and more on how, and with what degree of success, practitioners have attempted to receive institutional recognition from the university for their research.

Brad Haseman‚Äôs "performative research," which he says is "intrinsically experiential and comes to the fore when the researcher creates new artistic forms for performance and exhibition, or designs user-led online games (...)" Haseman‚Äôs usage of "performative" is borrowed from J. L. Austin‚Äôs [[speech act theory->Speech Act Theory]]. He emphasizes the primacy of the created object over as performative acts of research in and of itself; the artifacts "work performatively. They not only express the research, but in that expression become the research itself." Thus blah blah blah.

In critical making, conversely, the focus is on the "act of shared construction, joint conversation, and reflection" that happens during the process of creation. Unlike performative research, in critical making "the final prototypes are not intended to be displayed and to speak for themselves." Instead, the primary focus is on "using material production--making things--as part of an explicit practice of concept elaboration within the social study of technology." Although critical making is generally associated with the creation of material rather than virtual objects, the emphasis placed on the "shared acts of making rather than the evocative object" has guided my work in this section.

Importantly, though, my practice-based research is a series of adaptations rather than creations. This chapter, then, will be structured as a set of three experiments. I will begin each section with an explanation of the adapted text, with attention paid to what makes the text amenable to mechanical reproduction in the first place, and then move into an account of the process by which my adaptation was created as a way of drawing out features of the original texts. One of the guiding principles behind these adaptations is failure: although my goal is to do something that communicates some of what Beckett‚Äôs works do, something is inevitably lost in the translation from teleplay - or play - into what I‚Äôm going to loosely call a video game.

Although Beckett‚Äôs resistance to intermedial adaptation is sometimes, I think, overstated, the position of ‚Äòplayer‚Äô in a game - the position that these adaptations force the user into -  is radically different from that of ‚Äòaudience member‚Äô or ‚Äòviewer‚Äô or even ‚Äòactor,‚Äô and as such neither of these adaptations are faithful ones. Examining the ways in which they fail, however, is a useful way to think about what makes the original plays succeed. I offer failure here, then, as a reading strategy rather than as a judge of worthiness. Of course, making something that only fails would be a questionable - and dispiriting - use of time. As such, the secondary goal here is to look at what does work. Much is inevitably lost in translation, but some is, I hope, gained. So I‚Äôll also be thinking about how that position of ‚Äòplayer‚Äô is a potentially powerful one, and how these adaptations offer a different angle into these texts.

In <i>[[Almost to the Tick]]</i>, my second Beckett transcoding, the player types out the words of Beckett‚Äôs script. Each time they compete a phrase, a recording plays, with the Mouth uttering aloud the words typed. The mouth is just off center of the screen, lined up (roughly) with the player‚Äôs mouth; below, ghostly white letters float towards the mouth when typed.

You should play through the [[game->Almost to the Tick]] once before proceeding - or, if you don't have a Windows computer, watch the linked [[video->Almost to the Tick]].

This transcoding has more iterations than the others. The primary prototype used Billie Whitelaw‚Äôs 1973 recording for the Beckett on Film project, viewable [[here->Not I]]. This is not without its problems, legal and otherwise. For one, the video remains under copyright, like much of the material under examination in this chapter. Although my use falls, I contend, under the doctrine of [[fair use->Fair Use]], that contention is contentious.


:: Nanowatt {"position":"3444,1268","size":"100,100"}
Nanowatt, which is accessible <a target="_blank" href="http://nickm.com/post/2013/12/video-of-nanowatt-online/">here</a> is "a single-loading VIC-20 demo" by Montfort, Michael C. Martin, and Patsy Baudoin. The program outputs a section of Watt on an obsolete computing device and in so doing calls attention to the particular temporality of new media objects, among other things.


:: A transcoded body is still a body. {"position":"3719,2368","size":"100,100"}
The estrangement of the flesh-and-blood body effected by the move to digital life does not ultimately efface the body; instead, it creates, as McLuhan might say, extensions of the self. Bodies electric. 

We still stylize these bodies according to comprehensible codes as a way of performing ourselves into being. The flexibility of those performances has a different set of contingencies associated with them, though many of these contingencies ultimately overlap.


:: Stephen Connor {"position":"5975,100","size":"100,100"}
Stephen Kevin Connor, FBA is a British literary scholar who wrote two books primarily about Beckett: <i>[[Samuel Beckett: Repetition, Theory, and Text->Connor, Steven. Samuel Beckett: Repetition, Theory, and Text.]]</i> (1988) and <i>Beckett, Modernism, and the Material Imagination</i> (2014).

:: Ross Menkman‚Äôs 2010 Glitch Studies Manifesto {"position":"1990,2802","size":"100,100"}
<a target="blank" href="assets/pdfs/glitch_manifesto.pdf">Menkman's Glitch Studies Manifesto</a> posits that "the dominant, continuing search for a noiseless channel has been, and will always be, no more than a regrettable, ill-fated dogma." Through a variety of formal techniques, including visual glitch art, concrete poetry, and typographical flourishes, Menkman's maninfesto is a document whose form and content both embody the <<define "glitch" "Glitch">> it describes. The work emphasizes how the <<define "noise" "Noise">> necessarily involved in any communication channel is paradoxically both "negatively defined" and "a positive, generative quality."

<p>I'm not sure, if I had to do it again, that I'd try writing my dissertation in Twine. I'm glad I have; the artifact I created as a result is different in kind from other dissertations, which is interesting, and the technical work I had to do to create it certainly helped me in my career, first at the MIT Digital Humanities Lab and second in my professional life as a product manager at a company that builds, among other things, nonlinear learning experiences.</p>
<p>However, some of the features that made Twine appealing to me initially ‚Äî the nonlinear structure, the robust support for digressions ‚Äî exacerbated issues I have as a scholar. The codex and the book can digress, but its structure does not lend itself to distraction in quite the same way.</p>

<p>The definitions and [[Glossary]] stand as the most obvious example of this. To make them worth clicking, they needed to contain both descriptive information and argumentative material that relates to the document's thesis. This meant, however, spending a lot of time writing a lot of material that a more casual reader might not read. It also raised some of the same kinds of sequencing issues that an endnote- or footnote-heavy document might have; if the information is crucial to the argument, then it really ought to be in the body of the document, and if it's not crucial, then it may not need to be there at all.</p>
<p>This, coupled with the document's general nonlinear structure, meant that I had less control over what the user had read at any given point in their reading. This had a negative impact, I think, on the conclusions of each case study; because so much argumentation and theoretical work was done off the main path, the conclusions were sometimes anticlimactic.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as I progressed in the document past the first chapter, I found the upside: because I'd already defined Benjamin's <span class="glow"><<define "aura" "Benjamin's aura">></span> in the case study on [[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom->Case Study: MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM]], I didn't need to define it again when discussing [[Her Story->Case Study: HER STORY]] ‚Äî and the fact that the definition was active in both sections did some of the work of connecting the disparate case studies that make up the three primary sections of the document.</p>

<p>Because this document is concerned with the specificity of particular media ‚Äî what possibilities a platform opens up, and which possibilities are closed ‚Äî it was important to me to take particular advantage of the possibilities afforded by Twine. For the interactivity to be meaningful, it had to fulfill certain requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It had to engage the reader of the document in a way that would be difficult to achieve in a traditional book or codex;</li>
	<li>The mode of interactivity had to be connected to the object of study and to my argument in the case study;</li>
	<li>Some third requirement.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can rate how well each section's interactivity met each of these three goals on the forthcoming pages, which lays out how each case study is interactive, along with a reflection on its success or failure.</p>

<p>For <i>[[Blue Kettle->Case Study: BLUE KETTLE]]</i>, I wrote a custom macro to support the blockquotes from the text where <<blue "yes, like that">> and <<kettle "right, exactly, it toggles">> appear, allowing the user to toggle between the text and my best guess at the words replaced by the virus. This gives the case study a <<define "puzzle element">> ‚Äî or, at least, foregrounds the <<define "puzzle element">> that's already <<blue "there">> in the play, and about which the <<kettle "case">> study is focused. The <<blue "reader">> can play along, testing how well their <<kettle "decoding">> of the <<blue "text">> matches my own. A more <<blue "advanced">> version of this <<kettle "feature">> might use an alert pop-up to let the <<blue "reader">> <<kettle "type">> in their best <<blue "guess">>, and <<kettle "keep">> a <<blue "persistent">> <<kettle "score">>.</p>

<p>For <i>[[Achewood->Case Study: ACHEWOOD]]</i>, the embedded images and links were intended to mirror the web of sources that, together, make up the multimedia masculinity of its characters. By embedding the cookbooks, blogs, comic pages, and chatbots directly into the document, I intended to provide my reader with something like the experience of apprehending a character through so many different channels, within so many different genres. This was only so successful, and only took so much advantage of Twine itself. I think this is the weakest case study in the dissertation.</p>

<p>For <i>[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom->Case Study: MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM]]</i>, the goal was to embed as much music as possible and useful into the experience. Because the play is so concerned with the recorded voice, there is both value and interest in providing a direct portal to Ma Rainey's actual voice. There's something provocative about using the voice of a dead woman whose recordings no longer belong to anyone when the case study's argument is about that ownership. Additionally, it dovetailed nicely into the introduction of my discussion about <i>36 Blackbirds</i> and <<define "technonecromancy">> more generally. With more time, I would have embedded the audio directly into the pages rather than requiring the user to pause their experience to listen.</p>

<p>For <i>Her Story</i>, I embedded clips from the actual game, along with audio, in an attempt to let people who hadn't played the game experience some version of what they were missing. Because the game is made up of fractured interviews, experienced nonlinearly through short video clips, I thought there was a neat parallel to be made by embedding linear, contained clips into the experience. A more talented programmer than me would have attempted to mimic the database quality of <i>Her Story</i> in the structure of the case study itself, but that was beyond my abilities. Still, the sound and visuals afforded by the embedded clips allows the reader to have a richer understanding of the game ‚Äî and, hopefully, of my argument.</p>

<p>I was also able to include a pair of 'definitions' here that worked to make the reader experience something like the transdiegetic identification that the case study explores. The definition for <span class= "definition-link"><<link "MURDER">><<murder>><</link>></span> isn't a definition at all; it's a jump scare of Mouth from <i>Not I</i>, meant to shock the reader and, by elevating their heart rate, pull them into the experience; similarly, the definition for <<define "mirror">> enables the user's camera and keeps the little green "recording" light on their laptop until they close the dissertation. Both cases are meant to make the user uncomfortable, and to bring them out of the position of a passive reading subject into something more active.</p>

<p>For the case study about the alt-right, I wanted to give the user a sense of what it is like to actually browse the sites under discussion: 4chan, Reddit, and (to a lesser extent) YouTube. Although many people are familiar with the latter two, 4chan is a relatively niche platform. Unfortunately, screenshots were difficult to acquire; every time I logged onto /b/, the main image board for 4chan, there was too much explicit racism and/or CSAM (child sexual assault material) for me to feel comfortable exposing my readers to.</p>
