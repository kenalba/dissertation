<p>The concept of ‘information’ is both central to this project and incredibly challenging to define. As Maurice Lee puts it, "the only thing on which scholars of information agree is that no one agrees on what information is" <<cite "12" "Lee, Maurice. Overwhelmed: Literature, Aesthetics, and the Nineteenth-Century Information Revolution.">>. A comparative analysis of popular definitions of information demonstrates how impossible it is to divorce such a definition from its instrumental context; as such, I've provided below a few pithy definitions. Clicking into each link will bring you to the necessary contexts.

<p>A common starting point is engineer [[Claude Shannon's->Shannon Information]]: information is "a measure of one’s freedom of choice when one selects a message… the amount of information is defined, in the simplest cases, to be measured by the logarithm of the number of available choices" <<cite "9" "Shannon, Claude E. The Mathematical Theory of Communication.">>.</p>

<p>A similarly broad definition with more obvious applications to literary theory and to the problems at hand in this project is anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson's->Bateson Information]]. Bateson's information can be glossed as "a difference that makes a difference" <<cite "1972" "Bateson, Gregory. Steps to an Ecology of Mind.">></p>

<p>Philosopher of Information Luciano Floridi's gloss of information as "meaningful, well-ordered data" <<cite "8" "Floridi, Luciano. Information: A Very Short Introduction.">>rests somewhere between Bateson's and Shannon's; it is more precise than the anthropologist's and less strictly mathematical than the engineer's. That said, it contains three terms that themselves require further definition: [[meaning]], [[well-ordered]], and [[data]].</p>

<p>However, as intereventions from feminist scholars such as [[Catherine D'Ignazio]] and [[Lauren Klein]] demonstrate, these instrumental definitions can elide the degree to which information is always situated in and co-constituitive of culture - and, as such, can replicate and reify existing structures of [[oppression->Noble, Safiya. Algorithms of Oppression]]. In <i>[[Data Feminism]]</i>, D'Ignazio and Klein define information usefully as "definition goes here."</p> 

<p>Finally, for some philosophers of information, information makes up the fundamental structure of reality. "[[Informational structural realism->Informational Structural Realism]]", as it is called, posits a phenomenology whereby every "it" derives from a "bit."</p>


:: Shannon Information [definition nobr]
<p>Claude Shannon, the so-called father of information theory, spent World War II as a mathematician and electrical engineer working on cryptography at Bell Labs. He needed a quantifiable and mathematically manipulable definition of information for that work. For his specific purposes - cryptography and the creation of a mathematical theory of communication -  he defined information as:<p>
<b>"a measure of one’s freedom of choice when one selects a message… the amount of information is defined, in the simplest cases, to be measured by the logarithm of the number of available choices"</b> <<cite "9" "Shannon, Claude E. The Mathematical Theory of Communication.">>.</p>

<p>Although Shannon was careful to situate his definition as one suited to particular engineering challenges, the slippage between this technical definition and the broader notion of information appears as early as Warren Weaver’s introduction to Shannon’s <i>The Mathematical Theory of Communication</i>, which opens with the note that "the word communication," in the context of which the word ‘information’ is defined, "will be used here in a very broad sense to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another. This, of course, involves not only written and oral speech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theater, the ballet, and in fact all human behavior" <<cite "1" "Shannon, Claude E. The Mathematical Theory of Communication.">>. In a typical move for those theorizing about information, Shannon’s provisional and pragmatic definition ends up expanding to encompass everything humans do.</p>


:: Bateson Information [definition nobr]
<p>Gregory Bateson, who believed that the discovery of cybernetics, systems theory, and information theory gave him a "formal base enabling us to think about mind" and epistemology. The question he faced in his 1972 lecture "Form, Substance, and Difference," where he most famously articulated his definition of information, was the "unit of the mind" - and, more particularly, "what is it in the territory that gets onto the map?" That is to say, what is it about the objective world that makes its way into the subjective one? He argues that the answer to that question is difference, which is the sole cause of effects and is synonymous with the word "idea, in its most elementary sense" <<cite "56" "Bateson, Gregory. Steps to an Ecology of Mind.">>. He goes on to modify [[Kant->Critique of Judgment]]’s example of how humans make sense of a piece of chalk to clarify his point:</p>

<blockquote>[...] There are an infinite number of differences around and within the piece of chalk. There are differences between the chalk and the rest of the universe, between the chalk and the sun or the moon. [...] Of this infinitude, we select a very limited number, which become information. In fact, what we mean by information—the elementary unit of information—is a difference which makes a difference, and it is able to make a difference because the neural pathways along which it travels and is continually transformed are themselves provided with energy. <<cite "58" "Bateson, Gregory. Steps to an Ecology of Mind.">></blockquote>

<p>In short, information is "a [[difference->Derridean Difference]] that makes a difference."" The first 'difference' is, in its simplest form, a bit – a portmanteau for ‘binary digit,’ a zero or a one. The latter, however, pushes the informational out of the realm of mathematics and into the purview of the humanities. To make a difference is to have meaning, which implies a receiver capable of construing meaning. For N. Katherine Hayles as well as Bateson, this receiver can be one of a number of cognitive systems - a human mind, a smart phone, an e-reader - that processes data and embeds it in a particular context.</p>


:: Derridean Difference [definition nobr]
<p>Any discussion of difference with reference to the humanities must grapple with its most common appearance in contemporary theory through Derrida. Although scholars have drawn connections between Bateson’s 'difference' and Derrida’s (see especially White <<cite '17' '35' 'White, Michael. "Narrative Practices and Community Assignments."'>>), there are several major discontinuities between the two systems, the primary of which is epistemological. Whereas Bateson’s 'difference' acts as a channel between a map and a territory, Derridean poststructuralism rejects the existence of a territory itself. Bateson’s epistemology is thus ultimately foundational inasmuch as it claims a relationship between the object (the chalk) and the differences that make up the information we have about that chalk, and Derrida’s is (in extremely broad strokes) antifoundationalist inasmuch as difference says nothing about the chalk as a thing in itself and instead says something about the process of 'making sense' as a constant process of deferral.</p>


:: Informational Structural Realism [definition nobr]
<p>Philosophers working in the field of philosophy of information have gone as far as to suggest that information makes up the fundamental structure of the universe. John Archibald Wheeler, writing in 1969, posited that "every physical quantity, every it, derives its ultimate significance from bits, binary yes-or-no indications, a conclusion which we epitomize in the phrase, it from bit" <<cite '1' 'Wheeler, John Archibald. "Information, Physics, Quantum: The Search for Links."'>> – that is to say, the fundamental ontological unit is the binary digit. More recently, Luciano Floridi’s "Informational Structural Realism" (2007) identifies primordial information ("dedomena") as the foundation of any structure in any possible world. Terrell Bynum’s "Quantum Informational Structural Realism" (2014) goes one step further, citing "recent developments in physics, especially in quantum theory and cosmology" that "the universe is a vast ‘sea’ of quantum information (‘qubits’), and all objects and processes in our world (including human beings) are constantly changing quantum data structures dynamically interacting with one another" <<cite '1' 'Bynum, Terrell. "On the Possibility of Quantum Informational Structural Realism."'>>. These theories are distinct from but related to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis">simulation hypothesis</a> popularized by Nick Bostrom: briefly, given the possibility of simulating a universe on a Turing machine, the odds of our existence being simulation running on some higher-order machine vastly exceed the likelihood that this is the ‘prime’ universe. Whether or not Wheeler et al correctly identify the fundamental structure of the universe, that these ideas are being taken seriously by philosophers speaks to the centrality of information in the zeitgeist, and to the conceptual expansiveness of information as such.</p>

:: fair use [definition] {"position":"4319,2268","size":"100,100"}
In American copyright law, fair use is a legal doctrine that "<a target="_blank" href="assets/pdfs/fairuse.pdf"> promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances.</a> [[Section 107 of the Copyright Act]] provides the statuatory framework for determining whether something is a fair use and identifies certain types of uses -- such as <b>criticism</b>, comment, news reporting, <b>teaching</b>, <b>scholarship</b>, and <b>research</b> -- as examples of activities that may qualify as fair use." To evaluate a question of fair use, there are four legal factors and one practical one:
1) <i>Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.</i>;
2) <i>The nature of the copyrighted work</i>;
3) <i>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</i> - a question which often turns on whether or not the "heart" of the work is used; and 
4) <i>The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</i>.

Pragmatically, however, fair use is governed by a system of norms agreed upon by publishers and lawyers. Entities with the financial resources to hire enough more lawyers generally win these cases.

:: Benjamin’s aura [hs definition] {"position":"1615,2202","size":"100,100"}
"In even the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of art--its unique existence in a particular place. It is this unique existence--and nothing else--that bears the mark of the history to which the work has been subject."

"The authenticity of a thing is the quintessence of all that is transmissible in it from its origin on, ranging from its physical duration to the historical testimony relating to it."

[[Walter Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility," p21-22->Benjamin, Walter. "The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility."]]

:: Keyframes [definition] {"position":"3719,4368","size":"100,100"}
Per <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame">Wikipedia</a>, a key frame (or keyframe) in animation and filmmaking is "a drawing or shot that defines the starting and ending points of any smooth transition. These are called frames because their position in time is measured in frames on a strip of film or on a digital video editing timeline. A sequence of key frames defines which movement the viewer will see, whereas the position of the key frames on the film, video, or animation defines the timing of the movement. Because only two or three key frames over the span of a second do not create the illusion of movement, the remaining frames are filled with 'inbetweens'"

For animation, a keyframe can be thought of like a single snapshot of a stop-motion animation. Each keyframe is (generally) manually posed. This works differently than animation which leverages [[motion-capture data->Motion-capture data]] to transcode captured [[meatspace->Meatspace]] gestures into data that can be used to animate a model.

:: Meatspace [definition]
Meatspace is the analog inversion of cyberspace: the world of physical "meat suits" (that is, bodies). The term often attributed to William Gibson, who describes the meat/cyber binary in <i>Neuromancer</i> thusly:

"For Case, who’d lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the bars he’d frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh." <<cite "6" "Gibson, William. Neuromancer.">>

:: Section 107 of the Copyright Act [definition] {"position":"4194,2268","size":"100,100"}
"107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors."
