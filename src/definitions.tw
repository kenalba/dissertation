<p>The concept of ‘information’ is both central to this project and incredibly challenging to define. As Maurice Lee puts it, "the only thing on which scholars of information agree is that no one agrees on what information is" <<cite "12" "Lee, Maurice. Overwhelmed: Literature, Aesthetics, and the Nineteenth-Century Information Revolution.">>. A comparative analysis of popular definitions of information demonstrates how impossible it is to divorce such a definition from its instrumental context; as such, I've provided below a few pithy definitions. Clicking into each link will bring you to the necessary contexts.

<p>A common starting point is engineer [[Claude Shannon's->Shannon Information]]: information is "a measure of one’s freedom of choice when one selects a message… the amount of information is defined, in the simplest cases, to be measured by the logarithm of the number of available choices" <<cite "9" "Shannon, Claude E. The Mathematical Theory of Communication.">>.</p>

<p>A similarly broad definition with more obvious applications to literary theory and to the problems at hand in this project is anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson's->Bateson Information]]. Bateson's information can be glossed as "a difference that makes a difference" <<cite "1972" "Bateson, Gregory. Steps to an Ecology of Mind.">></p>

<p>Philosopher of Information Luciano Floridi's gloss of information as "meaningful, well-ordered data" <<cite "8" "Floridi, Luciano. Information: A Very Short Introduction.">> rests somewhere between Bateson's and Shannon's; it is more precise than the anthropologist's and less strictly mathematical than the engineer's. [[Data is the raw material out of which information is refined.->data into information]]. That said, it contains three terms that themselves require further definition: [[meaning->Meaning]], [[well-ordered->Well-Ordered]], and [[data->Data]].</p>

<p>However, as interventions from feminist scholars such as [[Catherine D'Ignazio]] and [[Lauren Klein]] demonstrate, these instrumental definitions can elide the degree to which information is always situated in and co-constituitive of culture - and, as such, can replicate and reify existing structures of [[oppression->Noble, Safiya. Algorithms of Oppression]]. In <i>[[Data Feminism]]</i>, D'Ignazio and Klein define information usefully as "definition goes here."</p> 

<p>Finally, for some philosophers of information, information makes up the fundamental structure of reality. "[[Informational structural realism->Informational Structural Realism]]", as it is called, posits a phenomenology whereby every "it" derives from a "bit."</p>


:: Shannon Information [definition nobr]
<p>Claude Shannon, the so-called father of information theory, spent World War II as a mathematician and electrical engineer working on cryptography at Bell Labs. He needed a quantifiable and mathematically manipulable definition of information for that work. For his specific purposes - cryptography and the creation of a mathematical theory of communication -  he defined information as:<p>
<b>"a measure of one’s freedom of choice when one selects a message… the amount of information is defined, in the simplest cases, to be measured by the logarithm of the number of available choices"</b> <<cite "9" "Shannon, Claude E. The Mathematical Theory of Communication.">>.</p>

<p>Although Shannon was careful to situate his definition as one suited to particular engineering challenges, the slippage between this technical definition and the broader notion of information appears as early as Warren Weaver’s introduction to Shannon’s <i>The Mathematical Theory of Communication</i>, which opens with the note that "the word communication," in the context of which the word ‘information’ is defined, "will be used here in a very broad sense to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another. This, of course, involves not only written and oral speech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theater, the ballet, and in fact all human behavior" <<cite "1" "Shannon, Claude E. The Mathematical Theory of Communication.">>. In a typical move for those theorizing about information, Shannon’s provisional and pragmatic definition ends up expanding to encompass everything humans do.</p>


:: Bateson Information [definition nobr]
<p>Gregory Bateson, who believed that the discovery of cybernetics, systems theory, and information theory gave him a "formal base enabling us to think about mind" and epistemology. The question he faced in his 1972 lecture "Form, Substance, and Difference," where he most famously articulated his definition of information, was the "unit of the mind" - and, more particularly, "what is it in the territory that gets onto the map?" That is to say, what is it about the objective world that makes its way into the subjective one? He argues that the answer to that question is difference, which is the sole cause of effects and is synonymous with the word "idea, in its most elementary sense" <<cite "56" "Bateson, Gregory. Steps to an Ecology of Mind.">>. He goes on to modify [[Kant->Critique of Judgment]]’s example of how humans make sense of a piece of chalk to clarify his point:</p>

<blockquote>[...] There are an infinite number of differences around and within the piece of chalk. There are differences between the chalk and the rest of the universe, between the chalk and the sun or the moon. [...] Of this infinitude, we select a very limited number, which become information. In fact, what we mean by information—the elementary unit of information—is a difference which makes a difference, and it is able to make a difference because the neural pathways along which it travels and is continually transformed are themselves provided with energy. <<cite "58" "Bateson, Gregory. Steps to an Ecology of Mind.">></blockquote>

<p>In short, information is "a [[difference->Derridean Difference]] that makes a difference."" The first 'difference' is, in its simplest form, a bit – a portmanteau for ‘binary digit,’ a zero or a one. The latter, however, pushes the informational out of the realm of mathematics and into the purview of the humanities. To make a difference is to have meaning, which implies a receiver capable of construing meaning. For N. Katherine Hayles as well as Bateson, this receiver can be one of a number of cognitive systems - a human mind, a smart phone, an e-reader - that processes data and embeds it in a particular context.</p>


:: Derridean Difference [definition nobr]
<p>Any discussion of difference with reference to the humanities must grapple with its most common appearance in contemporary theory through Derrida. Although scholars have drawn connections between Bateson’s 'difference' and Derrida’s (see especially White <<cite '17' '35' 'White, Michael. "Narrative Practices and Community Assignments."'>>), there are several major discontinuities between the two systems, the primary of which is epistemological. Whereas Bateson’s 'difference' acts as a channel between a map and a territory, Derridean poststructuralism rejects the existence of a territory itself. Bateson’s epistemology is thus ultimately foundational inasmuch as it claims a relationship between the object (the chalk) and the differences that make up the information we have about that chalk, and Derrida’s is (in extremely broad strokes) antifoundationalist inasmuch as difference says nothing about the chalk as a thing in itself and instead says something about the process of 'making sense' as a constant process of deferral.</p>


:: Informational Structural Realism [definition nobr]
<p>Philosophers working in the field of philosophy of information have gone as far as to suggest that information makes up the fundamental structure of the universe. John Archibald Wheeler, writing in 1969, posited that "every physical quantity, every it, derives its ultimate significance from bits, binary yes-or-no indications, a conclusion which we epitomize in the phrase, it from bit" <<cite '1' 'Wheeler, John Archibald. "Information, Physics, Quantum: The Search for Links."'>> – that is to say, the fundamental ontological unit is the binary digit. More recently, Luciano Floridi’s "Informational Structural Realism" (2007) identifies primordial information ("dedomena") as the foundation of any structure in any possible world. Terrell Bynum’s "Quantum Informational Structural Realism" (2014) goes one step further, citing "recent developments in physics, especially in quantum theory and cosmology" that "the universe is a vast ‘sea’ of quantum information (‘qubits’), and all objects and processes in our world (including human beings) are constantly changing quantum data structures dynamically interacting with one another" <<cite '1' 'Bynum, Terrell. "On the Possibility of Quantum Informational Structural Realism."'>>. These theories are distinct from but related to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis">simulation hypothesis</a> popularized by Nick Bostrom: briefly, given the possibility of simulating a universe on a Turing machine, the odds of our existence being simulation running on some higher-order machine vastly exceed the likelihood that this is the ‘prime’ universe. Whether or not Wheeler et al correctly identify the fundamental structure of the universe, that these ideas are being taken seriously by philosophers speaks to the centrality of information in the zeitgeist, and to the conceptual expansiveness of information as such.</p>


:: Data [definition nobr]
<p>Data comes from the Latin <i>datum</i>, meaning "that which is given." In philosophy, the term is used to refer to things like sense datum that are "immediately apprehended by or presented to the mind or senses" ([[OED->Oxford English Dictionary]]).</p>

<p>In computing, on the other hand, that same dictionary defines data as "the quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer and which may be stored or transmitted in the form of electrical signals and held on recording media" - that is, the grist out of which computer systems generate and represent meaningful information.</p>

<p>These two definitions are in conflict with one another, however. The philosophical definition gestures towards a percept prior to its interpolation in higher-order human cognition, outside of ideology. The technical one instead refers to patterns that exist within systems designed ([[generally->AI]])by people for people. This conflation is key to the epistemological sleight-of-hand undergirding some contemporary discourse around data, whereby conclusions arrived at via its manipulation project a patina of problematic and ersatz objectivity while in fact reifying and rearticulating the biases of designers who are overwhelmingly homogenous.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this study, I try to consider data as roughly equivalent to sensory data - that is, the preprocessed stuff out of which [[information->Information]] is gleaned - without losing sight of the ways in which the design of the technological systems that perform that transmutation of [[data into information->data to information]] (and gather that data in the first place) are always historically contingent and often dangerous.</p>

In American copyright law, fair use is a legal doctrine that "<a target="_blank" href="assets/pdfs/fairuse.pdf"> promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances.</a> [[Section 107 of the Copyright Act]] provides the statuatory framework for determining whether something is a fair use and identifies certain types of uses -- such as <b>criticism</b>, comment, news reporting, <b>teaching</b>, <b>scholarship</b>, and <b>research</b> -- as examples of activities that may qualify as fair use." To evaluate a question of fair use, there are four legal factors and one practical one:
1) <i>Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.</i>;
2) <i>The nature of the copyrighted work</i>;
3) <i>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</i> - a question which often turns on whether or not the "heart" of the work is used; and 
4) <i>The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</i>.

Pragmatically, however, fair use is governed by a system of norms agreed upon by publishers and lawyers. Entities with the financial resources to hire enough more lawyers generally win these cases.

"In even the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of art--its unique existence in a particular place. It is this unique existence--and nothing else--that bears the mark of the history to which the work has been subject."

"The authenticity of a thing is the quintessence of all that is transmissible in it from its origin on, ranging from its physical duration to the historical testimony relating to it."

:: Keyframes [definition] {"position":"3719,4368","size":"100,100"}
Per <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame">Wikipedia</a>, a key frame (or keyframe) in animation and filmmaking is "a drawing or shot that defines the starting and ending points of any smooth transition. These are called frames because their position in time is measured in frames on a strip of film or on a digital video editing timeline. A sequence of key frames defines which movement the viewer will see, whereas the position of the key frames on the film, video, or animation defines the timing of the movement. Because only two or three key frames over the span of a second do not create the illusion of movement, the remaining frames are filled with 'inbetweens'"

For animation, a keyframe can be thought of like a single snapshot of a stop-motion animation. Each keyframe is (generally) manually posed. This works differently than animation which leverages [[motion-capture data->Motion-capture data]] to transcode captured [[meatspace->Meatspace]] gestures into data that can be used to animate a model.

:: Meatspace [definition]
Meatspace is the analog inversion of cyberspace: the world of physical "meat suits" (that is, bodies). The term often attributed to William Gibson, who describes the meat/cyber binary in <i>Neuromancer</i> thusly:

"For Case, who’d lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the bars he’d frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh." <<cite "6" "Gibson, William. Neuromancer.">>

:: data into information [definition] {"position":"3721,5103","size":"100,100"}
The most naive way of expressing the distinction between [[data->Data]] and [[information->Information]] is to rely on Luciano Floridi's definition of information as "meaningful, well-ordered data" <<cite "8" "Floridi, Luciano. Information: A Very Short Introduction.">>. In this telling, data are the raw material out of which instrumentally useful information is made. In other words, as Lisa Gitelman and Virginia Jackson put it in the introduction to <i>'Raw Data' is an Oxymoron</i>, "data are apparently before the fact" <<cite "2" "Gitelman, Lisa. 'Raw Data' is an Oxymoron.">>.

Instrumentally, then, we can think about data as 'preprocessed' information that needs to be mined and refined until it's meaningful, like the raw sense data of [[Kantian cognition->Critique of Judgment]] that precedes the operations of the imagination and the understanding. Zeroes and ones, serialized dictionaries, and electrical variances become lights on a screen that make words, images, and other media with meaning; the former is data, the latter information.

However, as Gitelman's title suggests, this definition fails to account for the way in which data have to be "imagined <i>as</i> data to exist and function as such, and the imagination of data entails an interpretive base" <<cite "3" "Gitelman, Lisa. 'Raw Data' is an Oxymoron.">> -- and, as research and news stories on everything from cameras that can't see people of color to algorithms that re-enact redlining have demonstrated, an interpretive base is awfully close to an interpretive bias. Data cannot be prior to interpretation because its extraction is accomplished by human-made tools that can reflect the biases, blind spots, and bad motives of their engineers. Garbage in, garbage out.


:: glitch [definition todo] {"position":"3719,2968","size":"100,100"}
The glitch here is defined as both a technical term and as an aesthetic moment.

From a technical perspective, a glitch is, per the [[OED->Oxford English Dictionary]], "A surge of current or a spurious electrical signal; also, in extended use, a sudden short-lived irregularity in behaviour."

From an aesthetic perspective, however, the glitch is a moment when less becomes more, when the lossy contingencies of digital being paradoxically give rise to the production of something novel. This is often accompanied by a shift in the hermeneutic categorization of [[signal]] and [[noise]] as discrete; instead, under the sign of the glitch, the two switch places, intermingle, and become a new signal. 

In the context of informational performativity, we might think about the glitch as a mode of resistance to binary oppositions imposed by platforms. This passage requires expansion.

See [[Blue Kettle->Case Study: BLUE KETTLE]], [[Menkman's Glitch Studies Manifesto->Menkman, Ross. Glitch Studies Manifesto.]], and my discussion of the glitch in the context of [[Kant's account of aesthetic experience of beauty->Kant's Glitch]].

:: Kant's Glitch [definition todo]

This isn't done, but the rough parallel I'd like to draw is between the moment where the relationship between"signal" and "noise" is inverted and the "free play" of the imagination and the understanding in Kant's account of cognition. Below is some work that I've written about that very account of cognition; however, it needs to be cut down significantly and compared throughout to the glitch in a way that may not be worth the time and effort. Still, if you're interested in Kant, you may like to read this!

For Kant, power of judgment depends on the cognitive faculties: the sensibility (which is subserved by imagination) and the understanding. A brief digression: in the Critique of Judgment, Kant states that the two cognitive faculties are the imagination and the understanding; elsewhere, they are sensibility and the understanding, and the imagination is included in the sensibility. Because those two faculties are the ones in play for apprehension of the beautiful through a judgment of taste, this study will focus primarily on them. That is: when I refer to the cognitive faculties, I mean imagination and understanding. Sensibility is, more or less, the way we take in particulars from the world. This intuitive appropriation of the world itself is not governed by concepts yet – it’s just the raw input, before we’ve made any sense of it. The imagination synthesizes the raw input received from the sensibility into something like an image (or, in Kant’s words, “combines the manifold of intuition” (62)), which then gets passed over to the understanding. The understanding is the “law-giver,” which takes the processed image from the imagination and subsumes it under concepts, including the categories of the understanding (or, again in Kant’s words, provides “the unity of the concept uniting the [component] presentations (62)). There is some confusion here, depending on what Kant you’re reading: sometimes, it seems like the imagination synthesizes the input of the sensibility by applying the categories of the understanding; sometimes, it seems more like the imagination is the step just before the understanding, which gives the understanding the picture that the understanding makes sense of. I will use an example to illustrate the process as I understand ig.
For example, let’s take a chair. When I look at the chair, some stuff happens with light and my eyes are barraged with sensory input. This gets brought into my mind through the sensibility, which includes intuition. My imagination takes those particulars and synthesizes it into something that the understanding can work on: I have the image of the chair, but it hasn’t yet resolved into anything that makes any kind of sense. Think of it like letters to a dead language: the letters is there, but they mean anything until the understanding works on it. In normal cognition, the chair is then subsumed under concepts, especially the categories of the understanding – transcendental concepts which structure phenomenal reality. This is when the dead language starts to make words. I can make out the shape of the chair, I see that it resembles other chairs, and so on. The object of my perceptions is subsumed under concepts and becomes an intelligible element of my phenomenal existence. This is, in brief, how normal cognition works. And sometimes we like things that we cognize regularly: through the “taste of sense,” (58) we arrive at pleasure, and as a result we find the object agreeable (although, importantly, the agreeable is not universal and instead “everyone has his own taste” (55)).
The beautiful is something very different. It is never subsumed under a concept: indeed, this is one of the defining characteristics of the beautiful. It is also always disinterested. Cognition begins as normal: we receive sensory input through the sensibility. However, things change when the faculty of the imagination receives those particulars: rather than working in conjunction with the understanding to synthesize the image and subsume it under concepts, during a judgment of taste (how we arrive at the beautiful) intuitions are not subsumed under concepts. Instead, the imagination in its freedom from concepts “harmonizes with the understanding in its lawfulness” (151). Kant calls this harmonization “free play,” and states that “a judgment of taste must rest upon the pure sensation of both the imagination in its freedom and the understanding with its lawfulness, as they reciprocally quicken each other, i.e. upon a feeling that allows us to judge the object by the purposiveness that the presentation has insofar as it furthers the cognitive powers in their free play” (151). Pleasure in the sensation of the free play between imagination and understanding is the subjective experience of purposiveness in the presentation of an object – not the object itself – without any purpose and hence as “the mere form of purposiveness” (66). This pleasure is beauty: “Beauty is an object’s form of purposiveness insofar as it is perceived in the object without the presentation of a purpose” (84).
Another example might be helpful. Let’s take a rose. A woman sees, breathes deeply around, and touches this rose. She receives, through her senses and her sensibility, the raw data of the rose – that stuff goes into her mind. Her imagination is there to catch that data and start to synthesize it into something. So far, so good: normal cognitition is at play, and we’re at the same place here as we were with the chair. But her imagination, playing with the bits and pieces of ununified particulars she’s supposed to make into something – say, a chair – is baffled by the configuration of the bits. She goes to the understanding for help – normally, the imagination is in a reciprocal, collaborative role with the understanding in cognition and it’s difficult to fully separate the two – and the understanding reaches for the concepts. You can think about these concepts like measuring implements that allow the understanding to turn raw data into the phenomenal world. But something happens. The concepts can’t subsume the particulars; the rose cannot be measured (or, at least, some dimension of the rose cannot be measured). After a moment of trying, the understanding drops her ruler and starts just playing a game with the imagination. And instead of getting “rose,” the woman in whom all of this anthropomorphized cognition is taking place gets the sensation of free-play, which is beautiful. The rose is beautiful because, when the woman looked at it, it sent her imagination and her understanding into free play with one another, and so she experienced the sensation of beauty. 
It’s crucial to note here where ‘beauty’ is. On the one hand, beauty seems to be tied up in the object inasmuch as there are beautiful objects. However, Kant repeatedly says that the experience of beauty is subjective – or, at least, that the reflective judgment on the experience of free play which makes the mind aware of pure purposiveness, which is to say beauty, takes place in the subject. The apparent contradiction resolves, more or less, when we keep in mind the cognitive process outlined above: the object spurs the imagination and the understanding into free-play, but the free-play is the sensation of beauty. The sensation of beauty inheres in the subject, even if the object is beautiful. And the judgment of taste that results in beauty is always reflective: it is not a function of the object but instead of reflection upon the sensation of freeplay. This is where we get the “subjective” part of the definition of beauty as the subjective universal. 
But what about universality? Kant says repeatedly that beauty is “what, without a concept, is liked universally” (64). Some other things are universal in Kant’s system; the moral law, for example. If a thing can be made universal through the operation of reason, then that thing is objectively – or logically – universal. However, the tie between ‘universal’ and ‘objective’ is a common one. ‘Subjective’ is a byword for non-universal, conditional, all in the head of the subject and not tethered to the real universe, so “subjective universal” seems to be a contradiction. Beauty is clearly subjective inasmuch as the experience of beauty, and reflection on that experience which yields an awareness of pure purposiveness, takes place within the subject. How can something be universal that takes place within the subject?
Kant answers this question by appealing to what he calls a common sense. On the one hand, Kant says that a common sense is “the effect arising from the free play of our cognitive powers” (87) – which sounds an awful lot like the sensation of the beautiful. But that’s tautological – it doesn’t get us much deeper in? The translator’s note is again helpful here: it states that a “common sense” is the presupposition, a priori, that “taste and the feeling by which it judges is common to everyone” (lv). Because the liking of the beautiful is “our consciousness of... the form’s purposiveness for that harmony” (lx) and because the harmony “can be assumed to be the same for everyone,” we can assume that taste is grounded on a common sense. Even this argument has a ring of circularity to it, though. The necessary addition to the system – the final piece to this specific puzzle – is the notion of universal communicability, on which common sense and the possibility of a subjective universal depends.
Common sense is “the necessary condition of the universal communicability of our cognition, which must be presupposed in any logic and any principle of cognitions that is not skeptical” (88) and that “only under the presumption of such a common sense, I maintain, can judgments of taste be made” (87). Common sense is thus grounded on the idea of universal communicability and is a necessary element of the system if we are to escape from skepticism. But how does Kant justify universal communicability – beyond simply rejecting the skeptical hypothesis by appealing to experience, which isn’t his style? First of all, the bulk of Kant’s rejection of skepticism is in the first Critique; bootstrapping out of Descartes is beyond the scope of this paper. Kant assumes on this basis that we can communicate our empirical cognitions and our judgments with other people, and that we are understood when we do so. And because we can communicate our cognitions and our judgments, we can assume that “the cognitive powers presupposed by this common understanding are shared universally as well” (lx). In other words: we assume cognitions can be communicated because we are not skeptical. In order for us to be able to communicate cognitions,  the “attunement of the cognitive powers required for cognition in general” – the functional relationship between them that turns the particulars of the outside world into phenomenal reality / cognition – must also be universal communicable. This universally communicable functional relationship between the cognitive powers is the subjective condition of the process of cogntion, and is necessary in order for us to have cognition (88). Kant restates this later on in the Critique, approaching the question from a slightly different angle:
“The aptitude that human beings have for communicating their thoughts to one another requires that imagination and understanding be related in such a way that concepts can be provided with accompanying intuitions, and intuitions in turn with accompanying concepts, these intuitions and concepts joining together to form cognition... only where the imagination is free when it arouses the understanding, and the understanding without using concepts puts the imagination into a play that is regular, does the presentation communicate itself not as a thought but as the inner feeling of a purposive state of mind.” (163)
The attunement of the cognitive powers (imagination and understanding) varies depending on the objects given: imagination and understanding behave differently when they’re processing a chair than when they’re processing a jar of marmalade, for example. But because cognitions can be communicated, we can assume that the mental state of taking in marmalade and the mental state of taking in a chair – the attunement of the faculties which gives rise to the phenomenal world of chair or marmalade – is also communicable. 
Why does this mean that everyone ought to judge the same things to be beautiful? Beauty is a special case because, as we’ve mentioned, it does not depend on concepts. According to Kant, there is “one attunement” – one particular kind of input – “in which this inner relation is most conducive to the (mutual) quickening of the two mental powers with a view to cognition (of given objects) in general.” This is determined by feeling, rather than concepts: this “one attunement” is the experience of the beautiful. Because it is still an attunement of the cognitive faculties, which we’ve already proven are universally communicable if cognitions are to be communicated at all, it is universally communicable. It depends not on the individual, but on the sensation of the attunement of the imagination and understanding – free play. 
The imagination and the understanding interact with one another by a set of rules, grounded in the constitution of the mind – “an original contract dictated by our very humanity” (164), and because this rule is standard and valid for every human, the same input going into the same cognitive apparatus will produce the same sensation of beauty. This is necessary for cognition to be universally communicable and is the ground of the possibility of beauty as a subjective universal. It is subjective because the feeling of beauty inheres in the subject rather than in the object; it is universal because attunement of the understanding and the imagination are bounded by the same parameters in every human, and the free play of those cognitive faculties is a common sense to everyone: the sensation of pure purposiveness (Kant calls this the “universality of the subjective conditions for judging objects” (62)). This is why Kant can say that the person who proclaims something to be beautiful “requires the same liking for others” and judges “not just himself but for everyone” (55). In other words, perhaps dissatisfyingly, Kant states that “We must be entitled to assume a priori that a presentation’s harmony with these conditions of the power of judgment is valid for everyone” (155) because we’re able to talk to each other.
But people clearly do not always agree on what is beautiful. This is not a contradiction, according to Kant, because of the specifically conditional nature of the injunction towards agreement that the beholder of the beautiful posits. Kant states that “whoever declares something to be beautiful holds that everyone ought to give his approval to the object at hand and that he too should declare it beautiful” (86). The ought here, in an aesthetic judgment – a judgment about the beautiful – is merely conditional, and “the common sense... is a mere ideal standard” (89).  If I think this mountain is beautiful, it’s because I take in the mountain (which is common to everyone) through my sensibility (which is common to everyone) and then my imagination and understanding get quickened into free play (the conditions of which are common to everyone, according to common sense). 
Hence “we solicit everyone else’s assent because we have a basis for [the aesthetic judgment] that is common to all” (86). However, because we can’t be sure that instance – here, the mountain – has been “subsumed” – it’s possible that someone else could not experience the mountain as beautiful. What is on trial is the claim that beauty has on everyone’s liking, not the liking itself, because the liking itself could be conditioned by exterior factors like interest. Presuming that taste is deployed properly, that the subjects in question are properly disinterested, the cognitive faculties are harmonizing with one another properly, and the concepts are not in play (for concepts of the object cannot be involved in a judgment of the beautiful) the subject who judges something to be beautiful “cannot help judging that it must contain a basis for being liked [that holds] for everyone” (54).
Because taste isn’t always deployed properly, if we want universal agreement on questions of the beautiful we still have a role for the critic, who should “investigate our cognitive powers and what these tasks perform in these judgments” and “clarify by examples the reciprocal subjective purposiveness” whose form in a presentation is “the beauty of the object of this presentation” (150). The critic’s job is made more difficult because the beautiful cannot be subsumed under concepts of the object. Consequently, “there can be no rule by which someone could be compelled to acknowledge that something is beautiful” (59). There’s a tension here: on the one hand, the critic can help us figure out our cognitive powers, understand purposiveness, and become disinterested; on the other hand, because beauty is always subjective as well as being universal, we always want to submit the object to our own eyes – indeed, we have to. 
So taste is autonomous, because it is subjective, but the object of taste – the beautiful – is objective. We can talk to one another about taste – it is “precisely what stands most in need of examples regarding what has enjoyed the longest-lasting approval” (147) and in doing so hone our taste, make ourselves more receptive to the proper attunement of the cognitive faculties that is beauty. But, for Kant, the beautiful is only of empirical interest in society. Taste in society is “an ability to judge whatever allows even our feeling to everyone else” and is hence “a means of furthering something that everyone’s natural inclination demands [i.e., sociability]” (163). Because beauty is the reflective awareness of the pure purposiveness in free play, freedom, harmony, and so on, and because that feeling of beauty is the same in all people, beauty drives us to seek out others who agree with us. We claim that they should be able to because if they can feel what we can feel – and they can, if only their taste is operating correctly – we would have confirmation of our judgment of taste. Society hus operates as a sort of empirical testing-ground for our judgments of the beautiful. The beautiful confirms our place in society because it underlines the universal constitution of the human mind, with its drive towards free play, and the person who judges an object beautiful wants to share that with others.
